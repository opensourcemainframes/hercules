Move TAPEMAP functionality into HETMAP and deprecate TAPEMAP.
New -verbose option of HETMAP would produce existing display
whereas without it would produce the more compact single line
report format that the original TAPEMAP produced. The Blocks
count that the original TAPEMAP reported are actually chunks
and should be reported as such by HETMAP. The documentation
for both should also be appropriately updated.
