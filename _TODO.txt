                           HERCULES TODO IDEAS
                          ---------------------


                   (in absolutely *NO* particular order)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We should have a 'SetConsoleCtrlHandler' function to intercept Ctrl+C and
  Ctrl+Break, etc, signals/keystrokes to prevent Hercules from immediately
  exiting without having a chance to close its files and/or giving the guest
  an opportunity to shutdown cleanly beforehand. (i.e. we need to prevent
  clicking the [x] close button as well as provide a way to detect the user
  shutting down the system (or logging off) while Herc is still running.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  BUG? 'cmdtgt' support needs re-worked to prevent e.g. DIAG8 commands from
  being erroneously sent to (processed by) the guest instead of by Hercules.
  Issue was raised by Martin Trübner [Martin@pi-sysprog.de] on the main Herc
  list on 2/12/2010: setting 'cmdtgt', while handy in regards to letting you
  issue panel commands directly to the guest without having to precede the
  command with a '.', also unfortunately causes "hypervisor" commands (i.e.
  Hercules commands) issued via DIAG8 to be processed as GUEST commands and
  not Hercules (hypervisor) commands! Oops! (see "panel_command" function
  in 'cmdtab.c' near line 390 in the "#ifdef OPTION_CMDTGT" block) The fix
  MIGHT be to have an "internal" "panel_command" function that all of our
  internal functions can use instead, which would set a flag to FORCE the
  'cmdtab.c' logic to treat that specific call as "cmdtgt herc" instead?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Also provide separate zip file containing .PDB files for download for
  Windows snapshots (but especially for final official Windows releases!)
  so that on the rare occasion that Hercules ever does crash we're able
  to determine exactly where the crash occurred. We cannot do that without
  the .PDB files!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Design a more platform generic cpu features runtime check that checks for
  the availability of certain processor features and then points some sysblk
  function-pointers to the correct function. That way we can exploit certain
  features if they're available. Of course going through a function pointer
  may be too inefficient depending on where the function is being used, but
  depending on what the function (feature) provides it may end up being an
  overall gain than a loss.

  E.g. (WIN64):

    init_hostinfo:
    BOOL WINAPI IsProcessorFeaturePresent( PF_COMPARE_EXCHANGE128 );
    _INTEGRAL_MAX_BITS (machdep.h ==> _InterlockedCompareExchange128 ==> cmpxchg16b)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Support multiple command-line commands (i.e. cmdsep character).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Design a way for users to define command synonyms. (dynmod?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Document all DIAGNOSE instruction support

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Trace (instruction and/or device) to file instead of to console.
  (Then new utility to format/display it offline).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Windows block device support (i.e. ability to define an entire drive
  (Windows drive letter / partition) as a Hercules dasd)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  BUG: instruction tracing: control registers not being shown for some
  instructions which use/modify them. We need a better way to determine
  if FPRs/CRs/ARs should be traced or not. (New bits in INSTR table?)
  (see "display_inst_regs" function in "hscmisc.c")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Full 2540 reader/punch support!   mode=1 (normal), mode=2 (binary/"card image")
                                    hopper selection, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ability to specify highlighting for console messages via regex pattern.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Add MSVC support for 'MULTI_BYTE_ASSIST' (cpu.c "set_jump_pointers")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ISSUE: there's the possibility for "socketpair" function to connect to some
  other socket other than the pair's listening socket due to some other socket
  on the host already listening for connections on INADDR_LOOPBACK. Fix is to
  change the "socketpair" function to use a starting port# and SO_REUSEADDR
  in a 'setsockopt' call and detect (HSO_errno == HSO_EADDRINUSE) return code
  in its 'bind' call and auto-retry again using next port# (in a loop). Refer
  to the "console_connection_handler" function for reference.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Custom (dynmod?) default Code Page support

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  DUMP command (Windows only) to create on-demand mini-dump.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Device or facility per Gerhard Postpischil's 9/20/2007 suggestion
  that allows one to generate random "problems" (i/o errors, machine
  checks, etc) for better software error recovery testing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Add new "+rdbwd" 3590-device-only option to set flag in
  TapeCommands3590 table to allow/accept Read Backward CCW.
  (Requested by "herc_fun" = Charlie <os_390@hotmail.com>)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Add 'auto' option to MAXRATES command, to have it also issue
  the command automatically at the end of the interval (so you
  can monitor the rate).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "Generic-ize" the 'qd' command so that it works for ANY device
  instead of just dasd devices. SenseId and RDC (Read Device
  Characteristics) information is valuable information to display
  for devices other than dasd! (e.g. tape devices for example)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Add SRF (Suspend/Resume) support for tape devices.

  Add SRF (Suspend/Resume) support for CTC devices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  BCTC support for sysplex'ing via GRS.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Generic native host SCSI support (mostly for tape,
  but having it opens other interesting possibilities)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  QDIO/QETH (custom Herc device driver to directly update guest storage)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Large block support in channel subsystem (blocks > 64K ==> 2MB maximum?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
