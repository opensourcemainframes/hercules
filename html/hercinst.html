<h2>Installation Procedure</h2>
<a name="instsource"></a>
<h3>Building from source - Windows with Cygwin</h3>
<p>
For building the Cygwin version of Hercules on Windows, Volker Bandke
has instructions on his "<b>Building Hercules for Windows</b>" web page at
<a href="http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/hercules/herc_w32_2.html">http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/hercules/herc_w32_2.html</a>.
</p>

<h3>Building from source - Windows (without Cygwin)</h3>
<p>
For building the MSVC version of Hercules on Windows (a version of
Hercules that does <i>not</i> require Cygwin), Fish has instructions on his
"<b>MSVC Hercules Build Instructions</b>" web page at
<a href="http://www.softdevlabs.com/Hercules/hercules-msvc-build.html">http://www.softdevlabs.com/Hercules/hercules-msvc-build.html</a>.
</p>

<h3>Building from source - Linux and Mac OS X</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the distribution file
<a href="hercules-3.03.tar.gz">hercules-3.03.tar.gz</a>
<br><em>Note:</em> By downloading this file you agree to the terms
    of the <a href="herclic.html">Q Public Licence</a>.
<p>
<li>Use these commands to unzip the distribution file:
<pre>tar xvzf ../hercules-3.03.tar.gz
cd hercules-3.03</pre>

<li>Verify you have all of the correct versions of all of the
required packages installed:

<p><code>./util/cvslvlck</code>

<p><li>Configure Hercules for your system:

<p><code>./configure</code>

<p>By default, the configure script will attempt to guess appropriate
      compiler optimization flags for your system.  If its guesses
      turn out to be wrong, you can disable all optimization by
      passing the <code>--disable-optimization</code> option to
      configure, or specify your own optimization flags with
      <code>--enable-optimization=FLAGS</code>

<p>For additional configuration options, run: <code>./configure
          --help</code>

<p><li>Build the executables: <p><code>make</code>

<p><li>Install the programs: as root: <p><code>make install</code>
</ol>

<p>
<em>Important:</em>
You must use at least version 2.95 of the gcc compiler and the glibc2 library.
Refer to the <a href="hercfaq.html#3.04">
Hercules Frequently-Asked Questions</a> page for required
compiler and other software levels.

<a name="instbinary"></a>
<h3>Installing prebuilt RPMs:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the RPM file you want:
<ul>
<li><a href="hercules-3.03-1.i686.rpm">hercules-3.03-1.i686.rpm</a>: Intel
</ul>
<li>Install the RPM:
<br><code>rpm -Uvh</code> <i>RPMfile</i>
</ol>
<p>
This will leave the Hercules executables in /usr/bin and the dynamic
libraries in /usr/lib and /usr/lib/hercules, where you can run them
from anywhere. Sample configuration files will be placed in /etc/hercules,
and the IPLable card deck for the ZZSA standalone utility will be placed in
/var/share/hercules.

<h3>Installing Debian packages:</h3>
<p>
Debian packages are available for "woody" and later releases.

<ul>
<li>Using apt: <code>apt-get install hercules</code>
<li>Manually with dpkg:
  <ol>
    <li>Download a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/hercules">.deb
        package</a>
    <li><code>dpkg -i</code> <i>DEB</i>
  </ol>
</ul>

<h3>Installing on Mac OS X:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the compressed disk image: <a
href="hercules-3.03-panther.dmg">hercules-3.03-panther.dmg</a> if you're
running OS X version 10.3, or <a
href="hercules-3.03-tiger.dmg">hercules-3.03-tiger.dmg</a> if you're running
version 10.4 or later.
<li>Mount the image by double-clicking on it in the Finder.
Your web browser may have done that for you already.
<li>Installation and use instructions are in the
file <code>OS&nbsp;X&nbsp;ReadMe.rtf</code>.
<li>If you want to use CTC networking on your Hercules system, you will need
to install the supplied Tunnel driver. Note that, at this writing, the
Panther version of the driver works fine, but the Tiger version will hang
at Hercules shutdown, and you must reboot in order to clear the problem.
Unfortunately, the Panther driver will not work on Tiger at all.
</ol>

<h3>Installing on Windows (without Cygwin):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the self-extracting Windows archive: 
<ul>
<li><a href="hercules-3.03-native-p4.exe">hercules-3.03-native-p4.exe</a>:
Pentium 4
<li><a href="hercules-3.03-native-i686.exe">hercules-3.03-native-i686.exe</a>:
Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and AMD Athlon and up
<li><a href="hercules-3.03-native-i586.exe">hercules-3.03-native-i586.exe</a>:
Pentium and AMD K6
</ul>
<li>Run one of the above self-extracting archives to install the Hercules
executables on your system.
<li>You will probably also want to install Fish's Hercules GUI for Windows,
obtainable from
<a href="http://www.cbttape.org/~fish/hercgui-index.html">
http://www.cbttape.org/~fish/hercgui-index.html</a>
</ol>

<h3>Installing on Windows with Cygwin:</h3>
<ol>
<li>You must first install the Cygwin package.
Download the 'setup.exe' program from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">the Cygwin
site</a>, and run it. (Right-click on the
<img src="http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-icon.gif" border=0 alt="Cygwin!"> icon
labeled "<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe">Install or update now!
(using setup.exe)</a>" and select "Save Target As..." and then run it after
it's been downloaded) If it's not preselected for you,
select the libintl-2 package when you're presented with a list of packages
to install. (NOTE: Hercules version 3.03 was built with version 1.5.5 
of Cygwin, and may not work with other versions, as the
Cygwin library tends to have subtle incompatibilities from version
to version that Hercules seems to stress.)

<li>Download the self-extracting Windows archive: 
<ul>
<li><a href="hercules-3.03-cygwin-p4.exe">hercules-3.03-cygwin-p4.exe</a>: Pentium 4,
optimized (Fish) threads version
<li><a href="hercules-3.03-cygwin-i686.exe">hercules-3.03-cygwin-i686.exe</a>: Pentium
Pro/Pentium II and above, optimized (Fish) threads version
<li><a href="hercules-3.03-cygwin-i586.exe">hercules-3.03-cygwin-i586.exe</a>: Pentium,
optimized (Fish) threads version
</ul>
<li>Run one of the above self-extracting archives to install the Hercules
executables on your system. Also please note that Hercules has several file
paths compiled into the code, and so it is best to install the package
into the default directories unless you really know what you're doing.
</ol>

<p><hr><a name="config"></a>
<h2>Configuration Procedure</h2>
<p>
You will need to amend the configuration file
<em><b>hercules.cnf</b></em> to reflect your device layout and intended
mode of operation (S/370, ESA/390, or z/Architecture).
See the <a href="hercconf.html">Hercules Configuration File</a> page for
a complete description.

<p><hr><a name="dasd"></a>
<h2>Creating DASD volumes</h2>
<p>
The <a href="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</a> page
describes various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD
volumes. The compressed CKD DASD support is described in <a
href="cckddasd.html">this page</a>.

<p><hr><a name="operating"></a>
<h2>Operating Procedure</h2>
<p class="warning">
<em>Note: If you intend to run any licensed software on your PC
using Hercules, it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not
violate the software vendor's licensing terms.</em>

<h4>Loading a standalone program or operating system</h4>
<p>
To start Hercules enter this command at the Unix shell prompt:
<pre><code>hercules [-f <em>filename</em>] [&gt; <em>logfile</em>]</code></pre>
<p>
where <code><em>filename</em></code> is the name of the configuration
file
(the default is <b><em>hercules.cnf</em></b>),
and <code><em>logfile</em></code> is an optional log file which will
receive a copy of all messages displayed on the control panel.

<p>
Next connect a tn3270 client to the console port (normally port 3270).
The client will be connected to the first 3270 device address specified
in the configuration file (this should be the master console address).
If your master console is a 1052 or 3215, connect a telnet client
instead of a tn3270 client.

<p>
Now you can enter an ipl command from the control panel.

<p> 
The <em>ipl</em> command may also be used to perform a load from cdrom or
server.  For example if a standard SuSE S/390 Linux distribution CD is loaded
and mounted on /cdrom for example, this cdrom may then be ipl-ed by:
<em>ipl /cdrom/suse.ins</em>
<p>
The <em>attach</em> and <em>detach</em> commands are used to dynamically
add or remove devices from the configuration,
and the <em>define</em> command can be used to alter the device number
of an existing device.
<p>
The <em>devinit</em> command can be used to reopen an existing device.
The <em>args</em> (if specified) override the arguments
specified in the configuration file for this device.
The device type cannot be changed and must not be specified.
This command can be used to rewind a tape, to mount a new tape or
disk image file on an existing device, to load a new card deck
into a reader, or to close and reopen a printer or punch device.
<p>
In single-step mode, pressing the enter key will advance to the
next instruction.
<p>
There is also an alternate semi-graphical control panel.  Press Esc to
switch between the command line format and the semi-graphical format.
Press ? to obtain help in either control panel.
<p>
Some commands also offer additional help information regarding their syntax,
etc. Enter&nbsp; "<tt>help <i>&lt;command name&gt;</i></tt>" &nbsp; to display
this additional help information. (Note: not every command supports help)
<p>

<a name="RCFILE">
<h4>The &nbsp;hercules.rc &nbsp;(run-commands)&nbsp; file</h4>
</a>
<p>
Hercules also supports the ability to automatically execute panel commands
upon startup via the 'run-commands' file. If the run-commands file
is found to exist when Hercules starts, each line contained within it is
read and interpreted as a panel command exactly as if the command were
entered from the HMC system console.
<p>
The default filename for the run-commands file is "hercules.rc", but may be
overridden by setting the "<tt><b>HERCULES_RC</b></tt>" environment variable to the
desired filename.
<p>
Except for the 'pause' command (see paragraph further below), each command
read from the run-commands file is logged to the console preceded by a '> '
(greater-than sign) character so you can easily distinguish between panel
commands entered from the keyboard from those entered via the .rc file.
<p>
Lines starting with '<tt>#</tt>' are treated as "silent comments" and are
thus not logged to the console. Line starting with '<tt>*</tt>' however are
treated as "loud comments" and <i>will</i> be logged.
<p>
In addition to being able to execute any valid panel command (including the
'sh' shell command) via the run-commands file, an additional
'<tt><b>pause <i>nnn</i></b></tt>' command is supported in order to introduce
a brief delay before reading and processing the next line in the file. The
value <tt><i>nnn</i></tt> can be any number from 1 to 999 and specifies the
number of seconds to delay before reading the next line. Creative use of the
run-commands file can completely automate Hercules startup.
