<h1>Installing and Operating Hercules Version 2</h1>

<h2>Installation Procedure</h2>
<h3>Building from source</h3>
<p>These instructions apply to the Linux version. Volker Bandke has
instructions on how to build the Win32 version at <a
href="http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/hercules/nude_w32.html">http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/hercules/nude_w32.html</a>.
<ol>
<li>Download the distribution file
<a href="hercules-2.17.tar.gz">hercules-2.17.tar.gz</a>
<p>
<em>Notes:</em>
<ol>
<li>By downloading this file you agree to the terms
    of the <a href="herclic.html">Q Public Licence</a>.
<li>IE4 may report "problem with security settings or file does
    not exist" when downloading this file.  I do not know why.
    If you experience this problem, use IE5 or Netscape Navigator
    instead.
</ol>
<p>
<li>Use these commands to unzip the distribution file:
<pre>tar xvzf ../hercules-2.17.tar.gz
cd hercules-2.17</pre>
<li>Configure Hercules for your system:

<p><code>./configure</code>

<p>By default, the configure script will attempt to guess appropriate
	  compiler optimization flags for your system.  If its guesses
	  turn out to be wrong, you can disable all optimization by
	  passing the <code>--disable-optimization</code> option to
	  configure, or specify your own optimization flags with
	  <code>--enable-optimization=FLAGS</code>

<p>For additional configuration options, run <code>./configure
	      --help</code>

<li>Build the executables: <p><code>make</code>

<li>Install the programs: as root: <p><code>make install</code>
</ol>

<em>Important:</em>
You must use the egcs compiler and the glibc2 library.
Refer to the <a href="hercfaq.html#software">
Hercules Frequently-Asked Questions</a> page for required
compiler and other software levels.

<h3>Installing prebuilt RPMs:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the RPM file you want:
<ul>
<li><a href="hercules-2.17-1.i386.rpm">hercules-2.17-1.i386.rpm</a>: Intel
</ul>
<li>Install the RPM:
<br><code>rpm -Uvh</code> <i>RPMfile</i>
</ol>
This will leave the Hercules executables in /usr/bin, where you can run them
from anywhere. Sample configuration files will be placed in /etc/hercules,
and the IPLable card deck for the ZZSA standalone utility will be placed in
/var/share/hercules.

<h3>Installing Debian packages:</h3>

Debian packages are available for "woody" and later releases.  As of
this writing, "woody" is not yet released.

<ul>
<li>Using apt: <code>apt-get install hercules</code>
<li>Manually with dpkg:
  <ol>
    <li>Download a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/hercules">.deb
		package</a>
    <li><code>dpkg -i</code> <i>DEB</i>
  </ol>
</ul>

<h3>Installing on Mac OS X:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the compressed disk image: <a
href="hercules-2.17.dmg">hercules-2.17.dmg</a>
<li>Mount the image by double-clicking on it in the Finder.
Your web browser may have done that for you already.
<li>Installation and use instructions are in the
file <code>OS&nbsp;X&nbsp;ReadMe.rtf</code>.
</ol>

<h2>Configuration Procedure</h2>
<p>
You will need to amend the configuration file
<em><b>hercules.cnf</b></em> to reflect your device layout and intended
mode of operation (S/370, ESA/390, or z/Architecture).
See the <a href="hercconf.html">Hercules Configuration File</a> page for
a complete description.

<h2>Creating DASD volumes</h2>
<p>
The <a href="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</a> page
describes various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD
volumes. The compressed CKD DASD support is described in <a
href="cckddasd.html">this page</a>.

<h2>Operating Procedure</h2>
<p>
<em>Note: If you intend to run any licensed software on your PC
using Hercules, it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not
violate the software vendor's licensing terms.</em>

<h4>Loading a standalone program or operating system</h4>
<p>
To start Hercules enter this command at the Unix shell prompt:
<pre><code>hercules [-f <em>filename</em>] [&gt; <em>logfile</em>]</code></pre>
where <code><em>filename</em></code> is the name of the configuration
file
(the default is <b><em>hercules.cnf</em></b>),
and <code><em>logfile</em></code> is an optional log file which will
receive a copy of all messages displayed on the control panel.

<p>
Next connect a tn3270 client to the console port (normally port 3270).
The client will be connected to the first 3270 device address specified
in the configuration file (this should be the master console address).
If your master console is a 1052 or 3215, connect a telnet client
instead of a tn3270 client.

<p>
Now you can enter an ipl command from the control panel.

</pre>

<p> 
The <em>ipl</em> command may also be used to perform a load from cdrom or
server.  For example if a standard SuSE S/390 Linux distribution CD is loaded
and mounted on /cdrom for example, this cdrom may then be ipl-ed by:
<em>ipl /cdrom/suse.ins</em>
<p>
The <em>attach</em> and <em>detach</em> commands are used to dynamically
add or remove devices from the configuration,
and the <em>define</em> command can be used to alter the device number
of an existing device.
<p>
The <em>devinit</em> command can be used to reopen an existing device.
The <em>args</em> (if specified) override the arguments
specified in the configuration file for this device.
The device type cannot be changed and must not be specified.
This command can be used to rewind a tape, to mount a new tape or
disk image file on an existing device, to load a new card deck
into a reader, or to close and reopen a printer or punch device.
<p>
In single-step mode, pressing the enter key will advance to the
next instruction.
<p>
There is also an alternate semi-graphical control panel.  Press Esc to
switch between the command line format and the semi-graphical format.
Press ? to obtain help in either control panel.


<h4>The &nbsp;<u>hercules.rc</u> &nbsp;(run-commands)&nbsp; file:</h4>
<p>
Hercules also supports the ability to automatically execute panel commands
upon startup via the 'run-commands' file. If the run-commands file
is found to exist when Hercules starts, each line contained within it is
read and interpreted as a panel command exactly as if the command were
entered from the HMC system console.
<p>
The default filename for the run-commands file is "hercules.rc", but may be
overridden by setting the "<tt>HERCULES_RC</tt>" environment variable to the
desired filename.
<p>
Except for the 'pause' command (see paragraph further below), each command
read from the run-commands file is logged to the console preceded by a '> '
(greater-than sign) character so you can easily distinguish between panel
commands entered from the keyboard from those entered via the .rc file.
<p>
Lines starting with '<tt>#</tt>' are treated as "silent comments" and are
thus not logged to the console. Line starting with '<tt>*</tt>' however are
treated as "loud comments" and <i>will</i> be logged.
<p>
In addition to being able to execute any valid panel command (including the
'sh' shell command) via the run-commands file, an additional
'<tt><b>pause <i>nnn</i></b></tt>' command is supported in order to introduce
a brief delay before reading and processing the next line in the file. The
value <tt><i>nnn</i></tt> can be any number from 1 to 999 and specifies the
number of seconds to delay before reading the next line. Creative use of the
run-commands file can completely automate Hercules startup.
