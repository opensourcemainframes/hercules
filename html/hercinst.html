<h1>Hercules Version 3: Installation and Operation</h1>

<h2>Installation Procedure</h2>
<h3>Building from source</h3>
<p>These instructions apply to the Linux version. Volker Bandke has
instructions on how to build the Win32 version at <a
href="http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/hercules/nude_w32.html">http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/hercules/nude_w32.html</a>.
<ol>
<li>Download the distribution file
<a href="hercules-3.00.tar.gz">hercules-3.00.tar.gz</a>
<p>
<em>Notes:</em>
<ol>
<li>By downloading this file you agree to the terms
    of the <a href="herclic.html">Q Public Licence</a>.
<li>IE4 may report "problem with security settings or file does
    not exist" when downloading this file.  I do not know why.
    If you experience this problem, use IE5 or Netscape Navigator
    instead.
</ol>
<p>
<li>Use these commands to unzip the distribution file:
<pre>tar xvzf ../hercules-3.00.tar.gz
cd hercules-3.00</pre>
<li>Configure Hercules for your system:

<p><code>./configure</code>

<p>By default, the configure script will attempt to guess appropriate
      compiler optimization flags for your system.  If its guesses
      turn out to be wrong, you can disable all optimization by
      passing the <code>--disable-optimization</code> option to
      configure, or specify your own optimization flags with
      <code>--enable-optimization=FLAGS</code>

<p>For additional configuration options, run <code>./configure
          --help</code>

<li>Build the executables: <p><code>make</code>

<li>Install the programs: as root: <p><code>make install</code>
</ol>

<em>Important:</em>
You must use the egcs compiler and the glibc2 library.
Refer to the <a href="hercfaq.html#software">
Hercules Frequently-Asked Questions</a> page for required
compiler and other software levels.

<h3>Installing prebuilt RPMs:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the RPM file you want:
<ul>
<li><a href="hercules-3.00-1.i386.rpm">hercules-3.00-1.i386.rpm</a>: Intel
</ul>
<li>Install the RPM:
<br><code>rpm -Uvh</code> <i>RPMfile</i>
</ol>
This will leave the Hercules executables in /usr/bin and the dynamic
libraries in /usr/lib and /usr/lib/hercules, where you can run them
from anywhere. Sample configuration files will be placed in /etc/hercules,
and the IPLable card deck for the ZZSA standalone utility will be placed in
/var/share/hercules.

<h3>Installing Debian packages:</h3>

Debian packages are available for "woody" and later releases.  As of
this writing, "woody" is not yet released.

<ul>
<li>Using apt: <code>apt-get install hercules</code>
<li>Manually with dpkg:
  <ol>
    <li>Download a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/hercules">.deb
        package</a>
    <li><code>dpkg -i</code> <i>DEB</i>
  </ol>
</ul>

<h3>Installing on Mac OS X:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the compressed disk image: <a
href="hercules-3.00.dmg">hercules-3.00.dmg</a>
<li>Mount the image by double-clicking on it in the Finder.
Your web browser may have done that for you already.
<li>Installation and use instructions are in the
file <code>OS&nbsp;X&nbsp;ReadMe.rtf</code>.
</ol>

<h3>Installing on Windows:</h3>

<ol>
<li>You must first install the Cygwin package.
Download the setup program from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">the Cygwin
site</a>, and run it. If it's not preselected for you,
select the libintl-2 package when you're presented with a list of packages
to install. Hercules version 3.00 was built with version 1.5.5 
of Cygwin, and may not work with other versions, as the
Cygwin library tends to have subtle incompatibilities form version
to version that Herucles seems to stress.
<li>Download the self-extracting Windows archive: 
<ul>
<li><a href="hercules300-i686f.exe">hercules300-i686f.exe</a>: Pentium
Pro/Pentium II and above, optimized (Fish) threads version
<li><a href="hercules300-i586f.exe">hercules300-i586f.exe</a>: Pentium,
optimized (Fish) threads version
<li><a href="hercules300-i686p.exe">hercules300-i686p.exe</a>: Pentium
Pro/Pentium II and above, standard POSIX threads version
<li><a href="hercules300-i586p.exe">hercules300-i586p.exe</a>: Pentium,
standard POSIX threads version
</ul>
The Fish threads versions are recommended unless you encounter strange
problems.
<li>Run the self-extracting archive to install on your system.
</ol>

<h2>Configuration Procedure</h2>
<p>
You will need to amend the configuration file
<em><b>hercules.cnf</b></em> to reflect your device layout and intended
mode of operation (S/370, ESA/390, or z/Architecture).
See the <a href="hercconf.html">Hercules Configuration File</a> page for
a complete description.

<h2>Creating DASD volumes</h2>
<p>
The <a href="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</a> page
describes various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD
volumes. The compressed CKD DASD support is described in <a
href="cckddasd.html">this page</a>.

<h2>Operating Procedure</h2>
<p>
<em>Note: If you intend to run any licensed software on your PC
using Hercules, it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not
violate the software vendor's licensing terms.</em>

<h4>Loading a standalone program or operating system</h4>
<p>
To start Hercules enter this command at the Unix shell prompt:
<pre><code>hercules [-f <em>filename</em>] [&gt; <em>logfile</em>]</code></pre>
where <code><em>filename</em></code> is the name of the configuration
file
(the default is <b><em>hercules.cnf</em></b>),
and <code><em>logfile</em></code> is an optional log file which will
receive a copy of all messages displayed on the control panel.

<p>
Next connect a tn3270 client to the console port (normally port 3270).
The client will be connected to the first 3270 device address specified
in the configuration file (this should be the master console address).
If your master console is a 1052 or 3215, connect a telnet client
instead of a tn3270 client.

<p>
Now you can enter an ipl command from the control panel.

<p> 
The <em>ipl</em> command may also be used to perform a load from cdrom or
server.  For example if a standard SuSE S/390 Linux distribution CD is loaded
and mounted on /cdrom for example, this cdrom may then be ipl-ed by:
<em>ipl /cdrom/suse.ins</em>
<p>
The <em>attach</em> and <em>detach</em> commands are used to dynamically
add or remove devices from the configuration,
and the <em>define</em> command can be used to alter the device number
of an existing device.
<p>
The <em>devinit</em> command can be used to reopen an existing device.
The <em>args</em> (if specified) override the arguments
specified in the configuration file for this device.
The device type cannot be changed and must not be specified.
This command can be used to rewind a tape, to mount a new tape or
disk image file on an existing device, to load a new card deck
into a reader, or to close and reopen a printer or punch device.
<p>
In single-step mode, pressing the enter key will advance to the
next instruction.
<p>
There is also an alternate semi-graphical control panel.  Press Esc to
switch between the command line format and the semi-graphical format.
Press ? to obtain help in either control panel.
<p><br>
<h4>Additional Panel Command Help Information</h4>
<p>
<pre>
    help        Enter "help cmd" where cmd is the command you need help
                with. If the command has additional help text defined for it,
                it will be displayed. Help text is usually limited to explaining
                the format of the command and its various required or optional
                parameters and is not meant to replace reading the documentation.


    quit        Format: "quit [NOW]". The optional 'NOW' argument
                causes the emulator to immediately terminate without
                attempting to close any of the device files or perform
                any cleanup. Only use it in extreme circumstances.


    cpu         Format: "cpu nnnn" where 'nnnn' is the cpu address of
                the cpu in your multiprocessor configuration which you wish
                all panel commands to apply to. For example, entering 'cpu 1'
                followed by "gpr" will display the general purpose registers
                for cpu#1 in your configuration as opposed to cpu#0


    start       Entering the 'start' command by itself simply starts a stopped
                CPU, whereas 'start &lt;devn&gt;' presses the virtual start button on
                printer device &lt;devn&gt;.


    stop        Entering the 'stop' command by itself simply stops a running
                CPU, whereas 'stop &lt;devn&gt;' presses the virtual stop button on
                printer device &lt;devn&gt;, usually causing an INTREQ.


    .reply      To reply to a system control program (i.e. guest operating system)
                message that gets issued to the hercules console, prefix the reply
                with a period.


    !message    To enter a system control program (i.e. guest operating system)
                priority command on the hercules console, simply prefix the command
                with an exclamation point '!'.


    r           Format: "r addr[.len]" or "r addr-addr" to display real
                storage, or "r addr=value" to alter real storage, where 'value'
                is a hex string of up to 32 pairs of digits.

    v           Format: "v addr[.len]" or "v addr-addr" to display virtual
                storage, or "v addr=value" to alter virtual storage, where 'value'
                is a hex string of up to 32 pairs of digits.


    attach      Format: "attach devn type [arg...]


    define      Format: "define olddevn newdevn"


    devinit     Format: "devinit devn arg [arg...]"


    sh          Format: "sh command [args...]" where 'command' is any valid shell
                command. The entered command and any arguments are passed as-is to the
                shell for processing and the results are displayed on the console.


    b           Format: "b addr" where 'addr' is the instruction address where you
                wish to halt execution. Once the breakpoint is reached, instruction
                execution is temporarily halted and the next instruction to be executed
                is displayed. You may then examine registers and/or storage, etc. To
                continue execution after reaching a breakpoint, enter the 'g' command.


    b-          Format: "b-"  (removes any previously set breakpoint)


    pgmtrace    Format: "pgmtrace [-]intcode" where 'intcode' is any valid program
                interruption code in the range 0x01 to 0x40. Precede the interrupt code
                with a '-' to stop tracing of that particular program interruption.


    savecore    Format: "savecore filename [{start|*}] [{end|*}]" where 'start' and 'end'
                define the starting and ending addresss of the range of real storage to be
                saved to file 'filename'. '*' means address 0 if specified for start, and end
                of available storage if specified for end. The default is '* *' (beginning
                of storage through the end of storage; i.e. all of storage).

    loadcore    Format: "loadcore filename [address]" where 'address' is the storage address
                of where to begin loading memory. The file 'filename' is presumed to be a pure
                binary image file previously created via the 'savecore' command. The default for
                'address' is 0 (begining of storage).

    loadtext    Format: "loadtext filename [address]". This command is essentially identical
                to the 'loadcore' command except that it loads a text deck file with "TXT"
                and "END" 80 byte records (i.e. an object deck).

    script      Format: "script filename [...filename...]". Sequentially executes the commands contained
                within the file -filename-. The script file may also contain "script" commands,
                but the system ensures that no more than 10 levels of script are invoked at any
                one time (to avoid a recursion loop)


    cscript     Format: "cscript". This command will cancel the currently running script.
                if no script is running, no action is taken


    evm         Format: "evm". This command invokes ECPS:VM Subcommands.
                Type "evm help" to see a list of available commands
</pre>
<p><br>
<h4>The &nbsp;<u>hercules.rc</u> &nbsp;(run-commands)&nbsp; file:</h4>
<p>
Hercules also supports the ability to automatically execute panel commands
upon startup via the 'run-commands' file. If the run-commands file
is found to exist when Hercules starts, each line contained within it is
read and interpreted as a panel command exactly as if the command were
entered from the HMC system console.
<p>
The default filename for the run-commands file is "hercules.rc", but may be
overridden by setting the "<tt><b>HERCULES_RC</b></tt>" environment variable to the
desired filename.
<p>
Except for the 'pause' command (see paragraph further below), each command
read from the run-commands file is logged to the console preceded by a '> '
(greater-than sign) character so you can easily distinguish between panel
commands entered from the keyboard from those entered via the .rc file.
<p>
Lines starting with '<tt>#</tt>' are treated as "silent comments" and are
thus not logged to the console. Line starting with '<tt>*</tt>' however are
treated as "loud comments" and <i>will</i> be logged.
<p>
In addition to being able to execute any valid panel command (including the
'sh' shell command) via the run-commands file, an additional
'<tt><b>pause <i>nnn</i></b></tt>' command is supported in order to introduce
a brief delay before reading and processing the next line in the file. The
value <tt><i>nnn</i></tt> can be any number from 1 to 999 and specifies the
number of seconds to delay before reading the next line. Creative use of the
run-commands file can completely automate Hercules startup.
