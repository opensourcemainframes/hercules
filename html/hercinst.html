<h2>Installation Procedure</h2>
<a name="instsource"></a>
<h3>Building from source - Windows (without Cygwin)</h3>
<p>
For building the MSVC version of Hercules on Windows (a version of
Hercules that does <i>not</i> require Cygwin), Fish has instructions on his
"<b>MSVC Hercules Build Instructions</b>" web page at
<a href="http://www.softdevlabs.com/Hercules/hercules-msvc-build.html">http://www.softdevlabs.com/Hercules/hercules-msvc-build.html</a>.
</p>

<h3>Building from source - Windows with Cygwin</h3>
<p>
For building the Cygwin version of Hercules on Windows, Volker Bandke
has instructions on his "<b>Building Hercules for Windows</b>" web page at
<a href="http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/hercules/herc_w32_2.html">http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/hercules/herc_w32_2.html</a>.
</p>

<h3>Building from source - Linux and Mac OS X</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the distribution file
<a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/hercules-3.07.tar.gz">hercules-3.07.tar.gz</a>
<br><em>Note:</em> By downloading this file you agree to the terms
    of the <a href="herclic.html">Q Public Licence</a>.
<p>
<li>Use these commands to unzip the distribution file:
<pre>tar xvzf ../hercules-3.07.tar.gz
cd hercules-3.07</pre>

<li>Verify you have all of the correct versions of all of the
required packages installed:

<p><code>./util/cvslvlck</code>

<p><li>Configure Hercules for your system:

<p><code>./configure</code>

<p>By default, the configure script will attempt to guess appropriate
      compiler optimization flags for your system.  If its guesses
      turn out to be wrong, you can disable all optimization by
      passing the <code>--disable-optimization</code> option to
      configure, or specify your own optimization flags with
      <code>--enable-optimization=FLAGS</code>

<p>For additional configuration options, run: <code>./configure
          --help</code>

<p><li>Build the executables: <p><code>make</code>

<p><li>Install the programs: as root: <p><code>make install</code>
</ol>

<p>
<em>Important:</em>
You must use at least version 2.95 of the gcc compiler and the glibc2 library.
Refer to the <a href="hercfaq.html#3.04">
Hercules Frequently-Asked Questions</a> page for required
compiler and other software levels.

<a name="instbinary"></a>
<h3>Installing prebuilt RPMs:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the RPM file you want:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/hercules-3.07-1.i686.rpm">hercules-3.07-1.i686.rpm</a>: 32-bit Intel
<li><a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/hercules-3.07-1.x86_64.rpm">hercules-3.07-1.x86_64.rpm</a>: 64-bit Intel
</ul>
<li>Install the RPM:
<br><code>rpm -Uvh</code> <i>RPMfile</i>
</ol>
<p>
This will leave the Hercules executables in /usr/bin and the dynamic
libraries in /usr/lib and /usr/lib/hercules, where you can run them
from anywhere. Sample configuration files will be placed in /etc/hercules,
and the IPLable card deck for the ZZSA standalone utility will be placed in
/var/share/hercules.

<h3>Installing Debian packages:</h3>
<p>
Debian packages are available for "woody" and later releases.

<ul>
<li>Using apt: <code>apt-get install hercules</code>
<li>Manually with dpkg:
  <ol>
    <li>Download a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/hercules">.deb
        package</a>
    <li><code>dpkg -i</code> <i>DEB</i>
  </ol>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Installing on Gentoo Linux:</h3>
<p>Hercules is installed like any other Gentoo package: do <code>emerge
--sync</code> if you haven't done it lately, then <code>emerge
hercules</code>.</p>
<p>Do not try to override the optimization flags automatically selected by
<code>configure</code>. Hercules stresses the gcc optimizer, and will break
in subtle ways if the wrong optimization settings are used.</p>

<h3>Installing on Mac OS X:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the compressed disk image: <a
href="http://www.hercules-390.org/hercules-3.07-tiger.dmg">hercules-3.07-tiger.dmg</a>,
<a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/hercules-3.07-leopard.dmg">hercules-3.07-leopard.dmg</a>,
or <a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/hercules-3.07-snowleopard.dmg">hercules-3.07-snowleopard.dmg</a>.
This package is a universal binary and requires the OS X version in the
name, either 10.4 (Tiger), 10.5 (Leopard), 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or later. The
Leopard and Snow Leopard versions include native 64-bit host support, while
the Tiger version does not. The Tiger and Leopard versions will run on Intel
or PowerPC Macs, while the Snow Leopard version will only run on Intel, as
with Snow Leopard itself.
<li>Mount the image by double-clicking on it in the Finder.
Your web browser may have done that for you already.
<li>Installation and use instructions are in the
file <code>OS&nbsp;X&nbsp;ReadMe.rtf</code>.
<li>If you want to use CTC networking on your Hercules system, you will need
to install the supplied Tunnel driver.
</ol>

<h3>Installing on Windows (without Cygwin):</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a
href="http://www.hercules-390.org/hercules-3.07-w32.msi">Windows 32-bit
Installer package</a> or the <a
href="http://www.hercules-390.org/hercules-3.07-w64.msi">Windows 64-bit
Installer package</a>.
<li>Use the Windows Installer to install Hercules. The Windows Installer is
included in Windows XP. It may already be on your older Windows system,
depending on what other software you've installed. If it is, double-clicking
on the Hercules package file will install Hercules. If not, you can download
the Windows Installer for Windows NT and 2000 by following
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?releaseid=32832">this
link</a>, or the Windows Installer for Windows 98 and ME by following
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?releaseid=32831">this
link</a>.
<li>You will probably also want to install Fish's Hercules GUI for Windows.
You can get it from <a
href="http://www.softdevlabs.com/Hercules/hercgui-index.html">
http://www.softdevlabs.com/Hercules/hercgui-index.html</a>.
</ol>

<h3>Installing on Windows with Cygwin:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Hercules 3.07 is now supplied as prebuilt binaries only in a native Windows
version. This version will work perfectly well under Cygwin, as well as
native Windows, and does not require any specific version of the Cygwin
libraries. Follow the instructions above to install the native Windows
version.
</ol>

<p><hr><a name="config"></a>
<h2>Configuration Procedure</h2>
<p>
You will need to amend the configuration file
<em><b>hercules.cnf</b></em> to reflect your device layout and intended
mode of operation (S/370, ESA/390, or z/Architecture).
See the <a href="hercconf.html">Hercules Configuration File</a> page for
a complete description.

<p><hr><a name="dasd"></a>
<h2>Creating DASD volumes</h2>
<p>
The <a href="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</a> page
describes various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD
volumes. The compressed CKD DASD support is described in <a
href="cckddasd.html">this page</a>.

<p><hr><a name="operating"></a>
<h2>Operating Procedure</h2>
<a name="starting">
<p class="warning">
<em>Note: If you intend to run any licensed software on your PC
using Hercules, it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not
violate the software vendor's licensing terms.</em>

<h4>Starting Hercules</h4>
<p>
To start Hercules enter this command at the host's command prompt:
<blockquote><code><pre>
    hercules  [ -f <em>filename</em> ]
              [ -d ]
              [ -p <em>dyndir</em> ]  [[-l <em>dynmod</em> ] ... ]
              [ -s symbol=value ]
              [ &gt; <em>logfile</em> ]
</pre></code>
</blockquote>
<p>
where:
<blockquote>
<dl>
        <dt><code><em>filename</em></code><p><dd>

            is the name of the configuration file.
            The default, if none is specified, is <b><em>hercules.cnf</em></b>.
            The default may be overridden via the <code>HERCULES_CNF</code>
            environment variable.
        <p>
        <dt><code><em>-d</em></code><p><dd>

            specifies that Hercules is to be run in 'daemon' mode,
            wherein it runs invisibly with no attached console.
        <p>
        <dt><code><em>dyndir</em></code><p><dd>

            is the directory from which dynamic modules are to be loaded.
            The default depends on the host platform on which Hercules
            is being run. This option overrides the default.
        <p>
        <dt><code><em>dynmod</em></code><p><dd>

            is the name of an additional dynamic module to be loaded
            at startup. More than one additional module may be specified,
            although each must be preceded with the <code>-l</code>
            option specifier.
        <p>
        <dt><code><em>symbol=value</em></code><p><dd>

            the name of symbol and the associated value to be used in configuration
            processing or panel commands. See the command 'defsym'
            for more information on using symbols. The '-s' option maybe repeated. 
            Note: 'value' maybe quoted to contain imbedded blanks. 
        <p>        
        <dt><code><em>logfile</em></code><p><dd>

            is an optional log file which will receive a copy of
            all messages displayed on the control panel
        <p>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
Next connect a tn3270 client to the console port (normally port 3270).
The client will be connected to the first 3270 device address specified
in the configuration file (this should be the master console address).
If your master console is a 1052 or 3215, connect a telnet client
instead of a tn3270 client.

<p>
Now you can enter an ipl command from the control panel.

<a name="keyboard">
<h4>Using the keyboard</h4>
<p>

The main Hercules screen contains a scrollable list of messages with a command
input area and system status line at the bottom of the screen.
<p>
To scroll through the messages, use either the Page Up or Page Down keys,
the Ctrl + Up Arrow or Ctrl + Down Arrow keys, or the Home or End and/or
the Ctrl + Home or Ctrl + End keys.
<p>
Important messages are highlighted in a different color (usually red) and are
prevented from being scrolled off the screen for two minutes. If Extended Cursor
handling is available then important messages currently at the top of the screen
can be removed early by moving the cursor to the line containing the message
and then pressing enter.
<p>
Use the Insert key to switch between insert and overlay mode when typing in
the command input area. Use the Home and End keys to move to the first or
last character of the command you are typing, or the use the left/right arrow keys
to move to a specific character. Use the Escape key to erase the input area.
<p>
Pressing Escape when the command input area is already empty causes the screen
to switch to the semi-graphical "New Panel" display mode, which shows the overall
status of the system and devices.
<p>
When in the semi-graphical "New Panel" display mode there is no command input
area. Instead, single character "hot keys" are used to issue some of the more
common functions such as starting or stopping the CPU. The hot-keys are those
which are highlighted. Pressing the '?' key displays brief help information
on how to use the semi-graphical panel.

<p>
The <em>ipl</em> command may also be used to perform a load from cdrom or
server.  For example if a standard SuSE S/390 Linux distribution CD is loaded
and mounted on /cdrom for example, this cdrom may then be ipl-ed by:
<em>ipl /cdrom/suse.ins</em>
<p>
The <em>attach</em> and <em>detach</em> commands are used to dynamically
add or remove devices from the configuration,
and the <em>define</em> command can be used to alter the device number
of an existing device.
<p>
The <em>devinit</em> command can be used to reopen an existing device.
The <em>args</em> (if specified) override the arguments
specified in the configuration file for this device.
The device type cannot be changed and must not be specified.
This command can be used to rewind a tape, to mount a new tape or
disk image file on an existing device, to load a new card deck
into a reader, or to close and reopen a printer or punch device.
<p>
In single-step mode, pressing the enter key will advance to the
next instruction.
<p>
There is also an alternate semi-graphical control panel.  Press Esc to
switch between the command line format and the semi-graphical format.
Press ? to obtain help in either control panel.
<p>
Some commands also offer additional help information regarding their syntax,
etc. Enter&nbsp; "<tt>help <i>&lt;command name&gt;</i></tt>" &nbsp; to display
this additional help information. (Note: not every command supports help)
<p>
When a command is prefixed with '-', the the command will not be redisplayed at
the console. This can be used in scripts and is also used internally when commands
are to be invoked without being redisplayed at the panel.

<a name="RCFILE">
<h4>The &nbsp;hercules.rc &nbsp;(run-commands)&nbsp; file</h4>
</a>
<p>
Hercules also supports the ability to automatically execute panel commands
upon startup via the 'run-commands' file. If the run-commands file
is found to exist when Hercules starts, each line contained within it is
read and interpreted as a panel command exactly as if the command were
entered from the HMC system console.
<p>
The default filename for the run-commands file is "hercules.rc", but may be
overridden by setting the "<tt><b>HERCULES_RC</b></tt>" environment variable to the
desired filename.
<p>
Except for the 'pause' command (see paragraph further below), each command
read from the run-commands file is logged to the console preceded by a '> '
(greater-than sign) character so you can easily distinguish between panel
commands entered from the keyboard from those entered via the .rc file.
<p>
Lines starting with '<tt>#</tt>' are treated as "silent comments" and are
thus not logged to the console. Line starting with '<tt>*</tt>' however are
treated as "loud comments" and <i>will</i> be logged.
<p>
In addition to being able to execute any valid panel command (including the
'sh' shell command) via the run-commands file, an additional
'<tt><b>pause <i>nnn</i></b></tt>' command is supported in order to introduce
a brief delay before reading and processing the next line in the file. The
value <tt><i>nnn</i></tt> can be any number from 1 to 999 and specifies the
number of seconds to delay before reading the next line. Creative use of the
run-commands file can completely automate Hercules startup.
<p>
<hr width="50%">

<a name="HAO">
<h4>The "Hercules Automatic Operator" (HAO) Facility</h4>
</a>
<p>
The Hercules Automatic Operator (HAO) feature is a facility that allows one
to automatically issue panel commands in response to certain messages being
issued.
<p>
To use the Hercules Automatic Operator facility, one first defines a "rule"
consisting of a "target" and an associated "command". The "target" is just
a regular expression pattern used to match against the text of the various
messages that Hercules issues as it runs. Whenever a match is found, the
rule "fires" and its associated command is automatically issued.
<p>
The Hercules Automatic Operator facility is <i>only</i> for those messages
issued <i>by Hercules</i> to its HMC (hardware console). It <i>cannot</i>
be used for whatever messages the guest operating system may issue to any
of its terminals. It is only a <i>Hercules</i> automatic operator and
<i>not</i> a "VSE", "MVS", "VM", etc, automatic operator.

<h5>Defining a Rule</h5>
<p>
To define a HAO rule, enter the command:
<pre>
   hao <i>target</i>
</pre>
<p>
to define the rule's "target" match pattern (a simple regular expression),
followed by the command:
<pre>
   hao <i>command</i>
</pre>
<p>
to define the rule's associated panel-command.
<p>
The target pattern is a simple regular expression value as defined by
whatever regular expression facility your host build platform happens
to support. For Windows it must be a Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE).
For other supported build platforms it might be some other supported regular
expression syntax. Check your host platform's programming documentation for
further details.
<p>
The associated <i>command</i> is whatever valid Hercules panel command you
wish to issue in response to a message being issued that matches the given
pattern <i>target</i>.

<h5>Other commands and limitations</h5>
<p>
To delete a fully or partially defined HAO rule, first use the 'hao list'
command to list all of the defined (or partially defined) rules, and then use
the 'hao del <i>nnn</i>' command to delete the specific rule identified by <i>nnn</i>.
(All rules are assigned numbers as they are defined and are thus identified
by their numeric value). Optionally, one may delete ALL defined or partially
defined rules by issuing the command 'hao clear'.
<p>
The current implementation limits the total number of defined rules to 64. If
you need to define more than 64 rules you will either have to build Hercules
for yourself (increasing the value of the HAO_MAXRULE constant in hao.c) or
else beg one of the Hercules developers to please do it for you.
<p>
Note that there is currently no way to define a command whose arguments vary
based on actual message text. That is to say, there is currently no way to say
<blockquote>
<p>
   "Reply with the command 'devinit <i>cuu</i> filename'
   in response to message text 'HHCXXnnnI Device <i>cuu</i>
   intervention required.' where <i>cuu</i> is whatever cuu
    was identified in the message."
</blockquote>
<p>
The HAO is <i><b>not</b></i> that sophisticated (yet). Only simple plain-text commands may
be defined and issued. No automatic substitution is done based on message text
(although normal 'DEFSYM' symbol substitution <i><b>is</b></i> supported however, as that
is a normal panel-command feature supported separately from the HAO). This may
possibly change in the future however, depending on user need/demand.
<p>
<i><b>All</b></i> defined rules are checked for a match each time Hercules issues a message.
There is no way to specify "stop processing subsequent rules". If a message is
issued that matches two or more rules, each associated command is then issued
in sequence. Thus the advice to choose your rules' target patterns carefully
very much applies here.
