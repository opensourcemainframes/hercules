<em>&#147;
Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to see OS
running on a machine that I personally own.
Hercules is a marvelous tool.  My thanks to you all for a job
very well done.

<em>&#147;
I do miss my mainframe a lot, and playing with Herc sure brings back
memories.  Just seeing the IBM message prefixes, and responding to
console messages again was a wonderful bit of nostalgia!

I have installed your absolutely fantastic /390 emulator.
You won't believe what I felt when I saw the prompt.
Congratulations, this is a terrific software.
I really have not had such a fascinating and interesting
time on my PC lately.
