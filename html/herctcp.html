<h1>TCP/IP networking with Hercules</h1>
<p>
This page describes how to set up TCP/IP connectivity between
a Hercules machine and the outside world.
<p>
Since Hercules runs as a user process under the control of a driving
system (usually Linux/x86 or Windows), it does not have direct
access to the driving system's network adapter.  This presents a
problem in establishing connectivity between the network and the
TCP/IP stack of an operating system running under Hercules.
<p>
But thanks to a technique originally demonstrated by
Willem Konynenberg, it is possible to establish a virtual
point-to-point link between the TCP/IP stack running under
Hercules and the TCP/IP stack of the driving system.  The
driving system is then used as a router to pass IP frames
between the Hercules TCP/IP stack and the rest of the network,
as shown in the following diagram:

<p>
The virtual CTC link is provided by the Universal TUN/TAP driver
developed by Maxim Krasnyansky.  This driver creates a tunnel
which appears to Hercules as a character device (/dev/tun0) and
to the driving system as a virtual network interface (tun0).
The Hercules 3088 driver makes the /dev/tun0 device appear as
a CTCA (Channel to Channel Adapter) to the S/390 operating system
running under Hercules.  Each end of the link has its own IP
address which is distinct from the IP address of the driving
system's real network adapter.
<p>
The Universal TUN/TAP driver can be used if the driving system is
Linux, Solaris, or FreeBSD.  A Windows NT/2000 version of TUN/TAP
has been proposed, but does not exist yet at the time of writing.

<h2>Installing the Universal TUN/TAP Driver</h2>
<p>
If you are using Linux 2.4, you can skip this
section, because the TUN/TAP driver is included as a standard
feature of the kernel in Linux 2.4 and later.
<p>
Users of Linux 2.2, Solaris, or FreeBSD can install the TUN/TAP
driver using the following procedure:
<ol>
<li>Download the file tun-1.0.tar.gz from
    <a href="http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun">
    http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun</a>
<li>Build the driver using the following commands:
    <code>
    <br>tar xvzf tun-1.0.tar.gz
    <br>cd tun-1.0
    <br>configure
    <br>make
    <br>su </code>(enter the root password when prompted)<code>
    <br>make install
    <br>chgrp <em>xxxxx</em> /dev/tun*
        </code>(where <em>xxxxx</em> is the group under which
                you run Hercules)<code>
    <br>chmod g+w /dev/tun*
    <br>chmod o-r /dev/tun*
    </code>
<li>For Linux, edit the file <b><i>/etc/conf.modules</i></b>
    and add the following line:
    <br><code>alias char-major-90 tun</code>
    <br>This causes the TUN/TAP driver to be loaded automatically
    when the /dev/tun device is opened by Hercules.
</ol>

<h2>Enabling IP forwarding</h2>
<p>
You must ensure that your kernel is enabled for IP forwarding.
Popular Linux distributions usually have a configuration option
to enable IP forwarding or routing:
<ul>
<li>For RedHat, specify <code>net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</code> in
    the <i><b>/etc/sysctl.conf</b></i> file.
<li>For SuSE, specify <code>IP_FORWARD="yes"</code> in
    the <i><b>/etc/rc.config</b></i> file.
<li>If you cannot find this option in your distribution, the following
    command should work on any Linux 2.x kernel:
    <br><code>echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</code>
</ul>
<p>
Client systems which connect to TCP/IP applications running in
the Hercules machine need to have a routing entry which defines
the driving system as the gateway into the Hercules system.  An
example route definition for a Unix client system is shown below:
<code><pre>
route add 192.168.200.1 gw 10.1.2.1
</pre></code>
<p>
For a Windows client, go to Settings -> Control Panel -> Network ->
Configuration -> TCP/IP -> Properties -> Gateway
and add the driving system's IP address to the list of gateways.

<h2>Defining the link in Hercules</h2>
<p>
You must define a pair of CTC devices in the Hercules configuration
file.  The devices must be defined using an adjacent pair of even/odd
device numbers such as 0A00 and 0A01, as in this example:
<p><code>
<br>0A00 3088 CTCI /dev/tun0 1500 192.168.200.1 192.168.200.2 255.255.255.0
<br>0A01 3088 CTCI /dev/tun0 1500 192.168.200.1 192.168.200.2 255.255.255.0
</code>
<p>
Two IP addresses must be assigned, one for the driving system's
end of the link, and one for the Hercules end of the link.  For
this example I have chosen 192.168.200.1 for the Hercules IP
address, and 192.168.200.2 for the driving system's IP address.
Since this is a point-to-point link, any addresses may be chosen,
provided that the network part of the address (192.168.200 in
this example) does not conflict with any existing network
addresses used in your IP network.
<p>
In the above example, 1500 is the maximum transmission unit (MTU)
size, and 255.255.255.0 is the netmask.

<h2>Configuring the TUN interface</h2>
<p>
The tun0 network interface in the driving system must be configured
as a point-to-point link.  Because of the design of the TUN/TAP driver
(the tun0 network interface does not exist until Hercules has opened
the /dev/tun0 device), a special program called hercifc is provided
to configure the tun0 network interface.  This program is launched
automatically by Hercules 3088 CTC device initialization.
<p>
The Hercules <b><i>make install</i></b> procedure installs the
hercifc program into /usr/bin with an owner of root and setuid
file permissions which allow anyone to execute the program.  You
may wish to alter the file permissions so that the hercifc program
can only be executed by a userid in a particular group:
    <code>
    <br>su </code>(enter the root password when prompted)<code>
    <br>chgrp <em>xxxxx</em> /usr/bin/hercifc
        </code>(where <em>xxxxx</em> is the group under which
                you run Hercules)<code>
    <br>chmod o-rwx /usr/bin/hercifc
    <br>exit
    </code>

<h2>Configuring the Hercules TCP/IP stack</h2>
<h4>TCP/IP for VSE</h4>
<p>
This is an example of the configuration statements which you need
to include in the IPINIT00.L member of PRD1.BASE:
<pre>
SET IPADDR   = 192.168.200.001
SET MASK     = 255.255.255.000
DEFINE LINK,ID=CTCA00,TYPE=CTCA,DEV=(A00,A01),MTU=1500
DEFINE ROUTE,ID=LINUX,LINKID=CTCA00,IPADDR=0.0.0.0
</pre>
<p>
The CTC devices should be defined to VSE using the following
statements in the $IPLxxx.PROC procedure in IJSYSRS.SYSLIB:
<pre>
ADD A00:A01,CTCA,EML
</pre>

<h4>TCP/IP for MVS</h4>
<p>
This is an example of the configuration statements which you need
to include in the TCPIP.PROFILE dataset:
<pre>
DEVICE CTCDEV1 CTC A00
LINK CTCLINK1 CTC 0 CTCDEV1
HOME 192.168.200.1 CTCLINK1
GATEWAY
; Network      First Hop     Link Name Size   Subnet Mask  Subnet Value
192.168.200.2  =             CTCLINK1  1500   HOST
DEFAULTNET     192.168.200.2 CTCLINK1  1500   0
START CTCDEV1
</pre>
<p>
The CTC devices A00 and A01 should be defined to MVS as device
type 3088 in the IODF.

<h4>Linux for S/390</h4>
<p>
This is an example of the network definitions which you need
in a Linux/390 system running under Hercules:
<pre>
ifconfig ctc0 192.168.200.1 pointopoint 192.168.200.2 mtu 1500
route add defaultroute gw 192.168.200.2
</pre>
<p>
Linux/390 will autodetect the CTC devices A00 and A01
at startup and will assign the interface name ctc0.
