<h1>Hercules Version 2: Configuration File</h1>
<p>
This page describes the configuration file for the Hercules S/370,
ESA/390, and z/Architecture emulator.
<p>
The configuration file <b><i>hercules.cnf</b></i> contains the
processor and device layout.  It is roughly equivalent to the IOCDS on
a real System/390.  The configuration file is an ASCII text file.

<h3>Comment lines</h3>
<p>
Blank lines, and lines beginning with a pound sign ('#' - "hash" to
Europeans) or an asterisk, are treated as comments.
<h3>System parameters</h3>
<p>
System parameters may appear in any order but they must precede all
device records.  Each system parameter must be on a separate line.
The following system parameters may be specified:
<dl>
<dt><code>CPUSERIAL <em>xxxxxx</em></code>
<dd>specifies the 6 hexadecimal digit CPU serial
    number stored by the STIDP instruction
<dt><code>CPUMODEL <em>xxxx</em></code>
<dd>specifies the 4 hexadecimal digit CPU model number
    stored by the STIDP instruction
<dt><code>CPUVERID <em>xx</em></code>
<dd>specifies the 2 hexadecimal digit CPU version code
    stored by the STIDP instruction.
    The default version code is FD when ARCHMODE S/370 or ARCHMODE ESA/390
    is specified.  For the ESAME architecture mode 00 is used as default.
<dt><code>MAINSIZE <em>nnnn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the main storage size in megabytes, where
    <code><em>nnnn</em></code> is a decimal number
    in the range is 2 to 1024 
<dt><code>XPNDSIZE <em>nnnn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the expanded storage size in megabytes, where
    <code><em>nnnn</em></code> is a decimal number
    in the range is 0 to 1024
<dt><code>HTTPPORT <em>nnnn</em> [AUTH/NOAUTH] <em>[userid password]</em></code>
<dd>specifies the port number (in decimal) on which the HTTP server
    will listen. The port number must either be 80
    or within the range 1024 - 65535 inclusive. If no HTTPPORT statement is
    present or an invalid port number is specified, then the HTTP server thread
    will not be activated.<br>
    <tt>AUTH</tt> indictates that a userid and password are required to access
    the HTTP server, whereas <tt>NOAUTH</tt> indicates that a userid and password
    are not required. The userid and password may be any valid string.
<dt><code>HTTPROOT <em>directory</em></code>
<dd>specifies the root directory where the HTTP server's files reside.
    If not specified, the default value for Win32 builds of Hercules is the
    directory where the Hercules executable itself is executing out of, and for
    non-Win32 builds it is the directory specified as the default package
    installation directory when the Hercules executable was built (which can
    vary depending on how the Hercules package was built, but is usually
    <tt>/usr/local/share/hercules/</tt>).<br>
    Note: Windows users of Hercules who do not have the complete Cygwin package
    installed (i.e. only have the required Cygwin DLLs installed instead)
    should specify this value in the form: "<tt>/cygdrive/x/pathname/</tt>"
    where '<tt>x</tt>' is the Windows drive letter. For example, if the Windows
    directory where the http server's files reside is
    "<tt>K:\Hercules\html\</tt>", then you should specify
    "<tt>/cygdrive/k/Hercules/html/</tt>"
    on your <tt>HTTPROOT</tt> statement.
<dt><code>DIAG8CMD <em>disable/enable</em></code>
<dd>When set to enable, commands issued through diagnose 8 will be 
    executed by hercules as hercules commands.  When set to disable,
    commands issued through the diagnose 8 interface will be ignored.
    The default is disable.  Note that when this feature is enabled, systems
    running under hercules can even issue host commands through the hercules
    sh command.  Enabling this feature may have security consequences.
<dt><code>CNSLPORT <em>nnnn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the port number (in decimal) to which tn3270 and
    telnet clients will connect
<dt><code>NUMCPU <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the number of emulated CPUs.
    <em>Note:</em>
    Multiprocessor emulation is only available when the definition of
    the compile-time variable <code>MAX_CPU_ENGINES</code>
    in the file <em><b>hercules.h</b></em> has a value of more than 1.
    Multiprocessor emulation works best
    if your system has more than physical CPU, but you can
    emulate multiple CPUs even on a uniprocessor system
    and you may still achieve a small performance benefit.
    There is no point in specifying NUMCPU greater than 1 unless
    your operating system is able to support multiple CPUs, and
    if you do not need multiprocessor emulation then setting
    MAX_CPU_ENGINES to 1 at compile time may improve performance.
<dt><code>NUMVEC <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the number of emulated vector facilities. Default is one per
    CPU. Only available by default in ESA/390 mode.
<dt><code>CPUPRIO <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>is only valid when Hercules is run on a *ix (Linux/Unix) host and
    specifies the priority of the CPU thread. Default is a nice value of
    15, which means a low priority such that I/O can be scheduled and
    completed in favour of CPU cycles being burned. On Multi-CPU systems,
    a real CPU can be 'dedicated' to Hercules, by giving the CPU thread a
    very high dispatching priority (-20). Note that Hercules needs to be a
    setuid root program to allow it to reset its dispatching priority to a
    high (negative) value (ie. chown root.root hercules; chmod +s hercules)
<dt><code>LOADPARM <em>xxxxxxxx</em></code>
<dd>specifies the eight-character IPL parameter which is used
    by some operating systems to select system parameters
<dt><code>SYSEPOCH <em>yyyy</em></code>
<dd>specifies the base date for the TOD clock.  Use the default
    value (1900) for all systems except OS/360.
    OS/360 expects the base date to be 1960, but specifying this
    value causes an error because OS/360 regards 2000 as an invalid
    date.  For OS/360, <code>SYSEPOCH 1988</code> is recommended.
    This makes the year 2000 appear to be 1972.
<dt><code>TZOFFSET &plusmn;<em>hhmm</em></code>
<dd>specifies the hours and minutes by which the TOD clock will
    be offset from the current system time.  For GMT, use the
    default value (0000).  For timezones west of Greenwich, specify
    a negative value (example: <code>-0500</code> for US Eastern Standard
    Time, <code>-0800</code> for US Pacific Standard Time).
    For timezones east of Greenwich, specify a positive value
    (example: <code>+0100</code> for Central European Time,
    <code>+0930</code> for South Australian Time).
<dt><code>TODDRAG <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the TOD clock drag factor.  This parameter can be used
    to slow down the TOD clock by a factor of <em>nn</em>, which can
    improve the performance of some operating systems which consume
    significant amounts of CPU time processing timer interrupts.
    <em>Use of the TODDRAG parameter is no longer recommended.</em>
<dt><code>OSTAILOR OS/390 &#124; VM &#124; VSE &#124; LINUX</code>
<dd>specifies the intended operating system.  The effect of this
    parameter is to reduce control panel message traffic by
    selectively suppressing trace messages for program checks
    which are considered normal in the specified environment.
<dt><code>PANRATE SLOW &#124 FAST &#124 <em>nn</em></code>
<dd>specifies the panel refresh rate, in milliseconds between refreshes. SLOW
    is the same as 500, and FAST is the same as 50. A value less than the
    Linux system clock tick interval (10 on Intel, 1 on Alpha), or more than
    5000, will be rejected. SLOW is the default.
<dt><code>ARCHMODE S/370 &#124 ESA/390 &#124 ESAME</code>
<dd>specifies the initial architecture mode.
    Use <code>S/370</code> for OS/360, VM/370, and MVS 3.8.
    Use <code>ESA/390</code> for MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, OS/390, VM/ESA, VSE/ESA,
    Linux/390, and ZZSA.
    Use <code>ESAME</code> for z/OS and zLinux.
    When ESAME is specified, the machine will always IPL in ESA/390 mode,
    but is capable of being switched into z/Architecture mode after IPL.
    This is handled automatically by all z/Architecture operating systems.
<dt><code>DEVTMAX -1 &#124 0 &#124 1-n</code>
<dd>specifies the maximum number of device threads allowed.
    <p>Specify <code>-1</code> to cause 'one time only' temporary threads to be
	created to service each I/O request to a device. Once the I/O request is
	complete, the thread exits. Subsequent I/O to the same device will cause
	another worker thread to be created again.
    <p>Specify <code>0</code> to cause an unlimited number of 'semi-permanent'
	threads to be created on an 'as-needed' basis. With this option, a thread
	is created to service an I/O request for a device if one doesn't already
	exist, but once the I/O is complete, the thread enters an idle state waiting
	for new work. If a new I/O request for the device arrives before the timeout
	period expires, the existing thread will be reused. The timeout value is
	currently hard coded at 5 minutes. Note that this option can cause one thread
	(or possibly more) to be created for each device defined in your
	configuration. Specifying <code>0</code> means there is no limit to the
	number of threads that can be created.
	<p>Specify a value from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> to set an upper limit
	to the number of threads that can be created to service any I/O request to
	any device. Like the <code>0</code> option, each thread, once done servicing
	an I/O request, enters an idle state. If a new request arrives before the
	timeout period expires, the thread is reused. If all threads are busy when
	a new I/O request arrives however, a new thread is created <i>only</i> if the
	specified maximum has not yet been reached. If the specified maximum number
	of threads has already been reached, then the I/O request is placed in a queue
	and will be serviced by the first available thread (i.e. by whichever thread
	becomes idle first). This option was created to address a threading issue
	(possibly related to the cygwin Pthreads implementation) on Windows systems.
	<p>The default for Windows is <code>8</code>. The default for all other systems
	is <code>0</code>.
<dt><code>PGMPRDOS RESTRICTED &#124 LICENSED</code>
<dd>specifies whether or not Hercules will run licensed program product ESA
    or z/Architecture operating systems.  Specify <code>RESTRICTED</code> to
    make Hercules emulate an IFL (Integrated Facility for Linux) CPU. With
    this specified, licensed ESA or z/Architecture OSes will refuse to
    start. OS/390 and z/OS will enter an A7A wait state, with reason code 7,
    at IPL time.  Specify <code>LICENSED</code> to allow these operating
    systems to run normally. This parameter has no effect on Linux/390,
    Linux for z/Series, or any 370-mode OS.
    <p><b>NOTE: It is <em>YOUR</em> responsibility to comply with the terms
    of your license for the software you intend to run on Hercules. If you
    specify LICENSED and run a licensed operating system in violation of
    that license, then don't come after the Hercules developers when the
    vendor sends his lawyers after you.</b>
    <p><code>RESTRICTED</code> is the default. Specifying
    <code>LICENSED</code> will produce a message at Hercules startup to
    remind you of your responsibility to comply with software license terms.
<dt><code>IODELAY <em>usec</em></code>
<dd>specifies the amount of time (in microseconds) to wait after
    an I/O interrupt is ready to be set pending.  This value can also be
    set using the Hercules console.  The purpose of this parameter is to
    bypass a bug in the <b>Linux/390</b> and <b>zLinux</b> <code>dasd.c</code>
    device driver. The problem is more apt to happen under Hercules than
    on a real machine because we may present an I/O interrupt sooner than a
    real machine.  This problem is being pursued with IBM linux. Meanwhile,
    if <code>OSTAILOR LINUX</code> is specified, then this value defaults to
    <em>800</em> otherwise the value defaults to <em>0</em>.
<dt><code>CODEPAGE<em>codepage</em></code>
<dd>specifies the codepage conversion table used for ascii/ebcdic translation
    "default" specifies traditional hercules codepage, "437/037",
    "437/500" and "850/273" are also supported.
    If no codepage is specified then the environment variable HERCULES_CP
    will be inspected.  The default codepage used is "default"
</dl>
<p>
A comment preceded by a pound sign may be appended to any system
parameter statement.
<h3>Device records</h3>
<p>
The remaining statements in the configuration file are device records.
There must be one device record for each I/O device.  The format of
the device record is:
<p><code><em>devnum devtype</em> [<em>arguments</em>]</code>
<p>where:
<dl>
<dt><code><em>devnum</em></code>
<dd>is a 1 to 4 digit hexadecimal number, in the range 0000 to FFFF
    (for ESA/390) or 0000 to 0FFF (for S/370).  The device number uniquely
    identifies each device to the operating system.
<dt><code><em>devtype</em></code>
<dd>is the device type.  Valid device types are:

    </table>
<dt><code><em>arguments</em></code>
<dd>is a list of parameters whose meaning depends on the device type.
    The arguments required for each class of device are shown below.
</dl>
<h3>Arguments required for each device type</h3>
<dl>
<p>
<a name="loc3270">
<dt><em>Local non-SNA 3270 devices</em>
<dd>No arguments are required for this device type.  To use this
    device, a tn3270 client must connect to the host Linux machine
    via the port number specified in the CNSLPORT parameter.
    A valid tn3270 device type, such as IBM-3278, must be used.
    If your tn3270 client software allows you to specify a device
    type suffix (for example, IBM-3278@001F) then you can use the
    suffix to connect the client to a specific device number.
    If no suffix is specified, then the client will be connected
    to the first available 3270 device.
<p>
<a name="conprkb">
<dt><em>Console printer-keyboard devices</em>
<dd>No arguments are required for this device type.  To use this
    device, a telnet client must connect to the host Linux machine
    via the port number specified in the CNSLPORT parameter.
    If your telnet client software allows you to specify a device
    type suffix (for example, ansi@0009) then you can use the
    suffix to connect the client to a specific device number.
    If no suffix is specified, then the client will be connected
    to the first available 1052 or 3215 device. One optional argument
    may be specified: <code>noprompt</code>, if specified, will remove
    the message at the console prompting for input.
<p>
<a name="cardrdr">
<dt><em>Card reader devices</em>
<dd>The argument specifies a list of file names containing card images.
    Additional arguments may be specified after the file names:
    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><code>sockdev</code>
    <dd>indicates the card reader is a socket device wherein the
        filename is actually a socket specification instead of a
        device filename.  When used, there must only be one filename
        specified in the form: <code>port</code> or <code>host:port</code>
        or <code>sockpath/sockname</code>.  The device then accepts
        remote connections on the given TCP/IP port or Unix Domain
        Socket, and reads data from the socket instead of from a device
        file. This allows automatic remote submission of card reader
        data. See the <a href="hercrdr.html">Hercules Socket Reader</a>
        page for more details.
    <dt><code>eof</code>
    <dd>specifies that unit exception status is presented after
        reading the last card in the file. This option is persistent, and
        will remain in effect until the reader is reinitialized with the
        <code>intrq</code> option.
    <dt><code>intrq</code>
    <dd>specifies that unit check status with intervention required
        sense bytes is presented after reading the last card
        in the file. This option is persistent, and will remain in
        effect until the reader is reinitialized with the <code>eof</code>
        option.
    <dt><code>multifile</code>
    <dd>specifies, when multiple input files are entered, to
        automatically open the next input file and continue reading
        whenever EOF is encountered on a given file. If not specified,
        then reading stops once EOF is reached on a given file and
        an attention interrupt is then required to open and begin
        reading the next file.
    <dt><code>ebcdic</code>
    <dd>specifies that the file contains fixed length 80-byte EBCDIC
        records with no line-end delimiters.
    <dt><code>ascii</code>
    <dd>specifies that the file contains variable length lines of
        ASCII characters delimited by LF (line feed) sequences or CRLF
        (carraige return line feed) sequences at the end of each line.
    <p>
    If neither EBCDIC nor ASCII is specified, then the device handler
    attempts to detect the format of the card image file when the device
    is first accessed.
    Auto-detection is not supported for socket devices, and the default
    is ASCII if sockdev is specified.
    <dt><code>trunc</code>
    <dd>specifies, for ASCII files, that lines longer than 80
        characters are truncated instead of producing a unit check
        error.
    <dt><code>autopad</code>
    <dd>specifies, for EBCDIC files, that the file is automatically
        padded to a multiple of 80 bytes if necessary.
    </dl>
<p>
<a name="cardpch">
<dt><em>Card punch devices</em>
<dd>The argument specifies the name of a file to which the punched
    output will be written.
    Additional arguments may be specified after the file name:
    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><code>ascii</code>
    <dd>specifies that the file will be written as variable length
        lines of ASCII characters delimited by line feeds or
        carriage return line feed sequences at the end of each line.
        Trailing blanks are removed from each line.
        If the <code>ascii</code> argument is not specified, the
        file is written as fixed length 80-byte EBCDIC records with
        no line-end delimiters.
    <dt><code>crlf</code>
    <dd>specifies, for ASCII files, that carriage return line feed
        sequences are written at the end of each line.
        If the <code>crlf</code> argument is not specified, then
        line-feeds only are written at the end of each line.
    </dl>
<p>
<a name="printer">
<dt><em>Line printer devices</em>
<dd>The argument specifies the name of a file to which the printer
    output will be written.  The output is written in the form of
    variable length lines of ASCII characters delimited by line
    feeds or by carriage return line feed sequences.  Trailing
    blanks are removed from each line.  Carriage control characters
    are translated to blank lines or ASCII form feed characters.
    If the file exists it will be overwritten.
    Additional arguments may be specified after the file name:
    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><code>crlf</code>
    <dd>specifies, for ASCII files, that carriage return line feed
        sequences are written at the end of each line.
        If the <code>crlf</code> argument is not specified, then
        line-feeds only are written at the end of each line.
    </dl>
<p>
<a name="tapedev">
<dt><em>Emulated tape devices</em>
<dd>Four types of emulation are supported:
    <dl>
    <p><dt><b>SCSI tapes</b>
    <dd>The argument specifies the tape device name (usually
        <b><i>/dev/st0</i></b>).  SCSI tapes are read and written
        using variable length EBCDIC blocks and filemarks exactly
        like a mainframe tape volume.

    <dd>These are read-only files which usually reside on CDROM.
        OMA virtual tapes consist of one CDROM file corresponding
        to each physical file of the emulated tape.  An ASCII text
        file called the tape descriptor file (TDF) specifies the
        names of the files which make up the virtual tape.
        The argument specifies the name of the tape descriptor
        file (for example <b><i>/cdrom/tapes/uaa196.tdf</i></b>)
        <p>Each file on the virtual tape can be in one of three
        formats:
        <dl>
            <dt><code>TEXT</code>
            <dd><b><i>TEXT</i></b> files consist of variable length
                ASCII records delimited by carriage return line feed
                sequences at the end of each record.  Each record is
                translated to EBCDIC and presented to the program as
                one physical tape block.
            <dt><code>FIXED <em>nnnnn</em></code>
            <dd><b><i>FIXED</i></b> files consist of fixed length
                EBCDIC blocks of the specified length
                (<code><em>nnnnn</em></code>)
            <dt><code>HEADERS</code>
            <dd><b><i>HEADERS</i></b> files consist of variable
                length EBCDIC blocks.  Each block is preceded by a
                12-byte header.
        </dl>
        <p>If you have any IBM manuals in Bookmanager format on CDROM,
        you can see some examples of TDF files in the
        <b><i>\TAPES</i></b> directory on the CDROM.
    <p><dt><b>AWSTAPE files</b>
    <dd>These contain a complete tape in one file.  AWSTAPE files
        consist of variable length EBCDIC blocks.  Each block is
        preceded by a 6-byte header.  Filemarks are represented by
        a 6-byte header with no data.  This is the same format as is
        used by the P/390.
        The argument specifies the location of the AWSTAPE file
        (for example <b><i>ickdsf.ipl</i></b>)
    <p><dt><b>HET files</b>
    <dd>These contain a complete tape in one file and have the same
        structure as the AWSTAPE format with the added ability to have
        compressed data.
        The first argument specifies the location of the HET file.  The
        filename must end with ".het" to be recognized by Hercules as an
        HET file.
        (for example <b><i>023178.het</i></b>)
        <p>Additional arguments that allow you to control various HET settings
        are:
        <dl>
            <dt><code>AWSTAPE</code>
            <dd>The <b><i>AWSTAPE</i></b> argument causes HET files to
                be written in AWSTAPE format.  This basically, disables
                the additional features provided by the HET format.
            <dt><code>COMPRESS=<em>n</em></code>
            <dt><code>IDRC=<em>n</em></code>
            <dd><b><i>COMPRESS</i></b> and <b><i>IDRC</i></b> control
                whether compression should be used when writing to HET
                files.  The value <code><em>n</em></code> can be <b>1</b>
                to turn on compression (the default) or <b>0</b> to turn
                it off.  <b><i>IDRC</i></b> is a currently a synonym for
                <b><i>COMPRESS</i></b>, but may be used in the future to
                control other emulated tape drive features.
            <dt><code>METHOD=<em>n</em></code>
            <dd>The <b><i>METHOD</i></b> option allows you to specify
                which compression method to use.  You may specify
                <b><i>1</i></b> for ZLIB compression or <b><i>2</i></b>
                for BZIP2 compression.  The default is <b><i>1</i></b>.
            <dt><code>LEVEL=<em>n</em></code>
            <dd>The <b><i>LEVEL</i></b> option controls the level of
                compression.  It ranges from <b><i>1</i></b> for fastest
                compression to <b><i>9</i></b> for best compression.
                The default is <b><i>4</i></b>.
            <dt><code>CHUNKSIZE=<em>nnnnn</em></code>
            <dd>The <b><i>CHUNKSIZE</i></b> option allows you to create
                                HET files that contain different chunk sizes.  The AWSTAPE
                                (and therefore the HET) format allows each tape block to be
                                logically broken up into smaller chunks.  For instance, if
                                your S/3x0 application creates tapes with a block size of
                                27998, those blocks would be broken down into
                                <code><em>nnnnn</em></code> sized chunks.  To be honest, I
                                can't think of a reason you'd want to change this since
                                decreasing it may reduce compression performance, but it's
                                there if you want it.  The range is from <b><i>4096</i></b>
                                to <b><i>65535</i></b>.  The latter being the default.

<dt><em>Channel-to-channel adapters</em>
<dd>The first argument defines the emulation type, and the remaining
    arguments depend on the emulation type.  The following emulation
    types are defined:
    <dl>
    <p><dt><b>CTCI</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; (Channel to Channel link to TCP/IP stack)<p>
    <dd>A point-to-point IP connection with the TCP/IP stack of the
        driving system on which Hercules is running.  See the
        <a href="herctcp.html">Hercules TCP/IP</a> page for details.<p>
        (Note: The CTCI protocol is only for the Linux version of
        Hercules. For Windows, use the CTCI-W32 protocol instead).
    <p><dt><b>CTCI-W32</b>  &nbsp; &nbsp; (modified Channel to Channel link to Win32 TCP/IP stack)<p>
    <dd>A modified Win32 version of the CTCI protocol for the Windows
    crowd. See Fish's
        <a href="http://home.sprintmail.com/~dtrout/Hercules/ctci-w32-index.html">CTCI-W32</a>
        page for details.
    <P><dt><b>CTCT</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; (Channel to Channel Emulation via TCP connection)<p>
    <dd>An emulated CTCA to another Hercules system. Four arguments
        are required:<p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code><em>lport</em></code>
            <dd>specifies the local TCP port. This is the TCP port that
                Hercules will listen on for this CTCA.
            <dt><code><em>rhost</em></code>
            <dd>specifies the remote host. This is the name or IP address
                of the remote system that Hercules is running on, not the
                name or IP address of the OS running on that copy of
                Hercules.
            <dt><code><em>rport</em></code>
            <dd>specifies the remote TCP port. The rport parameter on this
                system must match the lport parameter on the remote system,
                and vice versa.
            <dt><code><em>bufsize</em></code>
            <dd>specifies the buffer size for the link. If this link is used
                for IP traffic, this parameter should be more than the MTU
                of the interface definition in the OS.
        </dl>
    </dl>
    <p>If the first parameter is not one of the recognized CTC emulation
    types, then the driver will operate as in Hercules Version 1, using
    Willem Konynenberg's vmnet package, as described in Axel Schwarzer's
    <a href="http://www.kiyoinc.com/herc3088.html">CTCA 3088</a> document.

<a name="fbadasd">
<dt><em>FBA DASD devices</em>
<dd>The argument specifies the name of a file which contains the FBA
    DASD image.  The file consists of fixed length 512-byte records,
    each of which represents one physical block of the emulated disk.
    <p>
    To allow access to a minidisk within a full-pack FBA DASD image
    file, two additional arguments may be specified after the file
    name:
    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><code><em>origin</em></code>
    <dd>specifies the relative block number within the DASD image
        file at which the minidisk begins.  The number must be less
        than the number of blocks in the file.  The default origin
        is zero.
    <dt><code><em>numblks</em></code>
    <dd>specifies the number of 512-byte blocks in the minidisk.
        This number must not exceed the number of blocks in the file
        minus the origin.
        If omitted, or if specified as an asterisk, then the minidisk
        continues to the end of the DASD image file.
    </dl>
<p>
<a name="ckddasd">
<dt><em>CKD DASD devices</em>
<dd>The argument specifies the name of a file containing the disk CKD
    DASD image.  The file consists of a 512-byte device header record
    followed by fixed length track images.  The length of each track
    image depends on the emulated device type, and is always rounded
    up to the next multiple of 512 bytes.
    <p>
    Volumes larger than 2GB (for example, the 3390 model 3)
    are supported by spreading the data across more than one file.
    Each file contains a whole number of cylinders.  The first file
    (which contains cylinders 0-2518 in the case of a 3390) usually
    has _1 as the last two characters of its name.  The ckddasd driver
    allocates the remaining files by replacing the last character of
    the file name by the characters 2, 3, etc.
    <p>
    <em>When CKD DASD images are spread across multiple files, you must
    specify only the first file name (the file with suffix _1) in the
    configuration statement!</em>
    <p>
    Alternatively, the argument may specify the name of a file containing
    a compressed CKD DASD image.  The CKD driver will automatically detect
    whether the file contains a regular CKD image or a compressed CKD
    image.  Refer to the <a href="cckddasd.html">CCKD</a> page for details
    of how to create and use compressed CKD DASD images.
