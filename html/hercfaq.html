<H1>Hercules Version 2: Frequently-Asked Questions</H1>
<P><HR></P>
<H4>What is Hercules?</H4>
<P>Hercules is a software implementation of the System/370, ESA/390
and z/Architecture
hardware which runs under Linux on several hardware platforms including the
Intel Pentium PC, and under Windows NT and Windows 2000.</P>
<H4>So what exactly does that mean?</H4>
<P>It means that your PC can emulate an IBM mainframe processor. The
mainframe can range from a 360 to a z900 - running in "System/370" mode,
"ESA/390" mode, or "z/Architecture" mode.
Hercules executes S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture instructions and channel
programs.  It emulates mainframe I/O devices by using PC devices.  For
example, 3390 DASD devices are emulated by large files on your hard disk,
and local 3270 screens are emulated by tn3270 sessions. (Note: Not all 370
and 390 features have been implemented in Hercules. See the list of
particulars later in this document.  Also, certain non-standard models,
360/20s, and the 360/67 virtual memory mode are not emulated.)</P>
<P>Hercules implements only the raw S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture
instruction set; it
does not provide any operating system facilities. This means that you need
to provide an operating system or standalone program which Hercules can load
from an emulated disk or tape device. You will have to write the operating
system or standalone program yourself, unless you can manage to obtain a
license from IBM to run one of their operating systems on your PC, or use
IBM programs and operating systems which have been placed in the public
domain. </P>
<H4>Is it functional enough to run production work?</H4>
<P>No. At the moment it's a system programmer's toy, though it's rapidly
becoming good enough to run a wide range of software without problems. </P>
<H4>Can it run z/OS, z/VM, VSE/ESA, Linux/390 and Linux for zSeries?</H4>
<P>Yes. Hercules is a software implementation of the architecture, and so
it is capable of running Linux, z/OS, VSE/ESA, and z/VM, as well as older
versions of these OS's.</P>
<H4>What IBM operating systems can I run legally?</H4>
<P>Linux/390 and Linux for zSeries can be run as there are no
licensing issues involved.</P>
<P>OS/360 (PCP, MFT and MVT), as far as I know. OS/360 is in the public
domain. The status of OSes for which IBM did not charge a license fee is
somewhat murky; these include MVS 3.8, VM/370 release 6, and DOS/VS release
34. OS/390 and other ESA versions of OS's are definitely licensed to a
particular machine. Therefore, in practice you cannot run any ESA operating
system on your PC unless you can obtain a license from IBM allowing you to
do so. It is believed that there are, however, three legal ways you could
run z/OS, z/VM, or VSE/ESA under Hercules: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Running under Linux on the Pentium processor of a P/390 which is
licensed to run the OS. </LI>
<LI>Running under Linux/390 on a mainframe which is licensed to run the OS.
</LI>
<LI>Running under the terms of a disaster recovery provision of the OS
license (but I really don't recommend depending on Hercules to be your
disaster recovery solution!). </LI></OL>
<H4>What other programs will run under Hercules? </H4>
<P>Any program which uses the S/370, ESA/390, or z/Architecture
instruction set, as
implemented in Hercules. Some special utilities in the form of standalone
programs are known to run well. I can particularly recommend Jan Jaeger's
excellent standalone editor (ZZSA) which is included in the Hercules
distribution, or it can be downloaded from <A
HREF="http://home.worldonline.nl/~jjaeger">http://home.worldonline.nl/~jjaeger</A>;
I use it regularly to look at DASD while debugging an OS installation, which
is just what it's designed to do. Note: ZZSA runs in ESA/390 mode.
See Jan Jaeger's website for more information and special
logon procedures.</P>
<H4>Where can I obtain OS/360?</H4>
<P>1. Rick Fochtman's OS/360 archive CD is now obtainable by download from
these locations: </P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cyberdynesys.com/os360.tgz">http://www.cyberdynesys.com/os360.tgz</A> </LI>
<LI><A HREF="ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/hercos360/os360.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/hercos360/os360.tar.gz</A> </LI></UL>
<P>2. If you are interested in obtaining a copy of the CD itself, contact
Rick Fochtman at <EM>rfochtman </EM>@<EM> ync.net</EM>. </P>
<P>You can use the <CODE>dasdload</CODE> and <CODE>dasdisup</CODE> programs
(see the <A HREF="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</A> document) to
build an OS/360 IPL volume from the unloaded files on the archive CD. </P>
<P>3. Alternatively, you can download the <A
HREF="mftr33.tar.gz">mftr33.tar.gz</A> package which contains a minimal MFT
system on a 3330 image, with some minimal documentation. The configuration
is that of a 370/145 with 2 megabytes of main storage, running OS/MFT
Release 21.0, with several volumes of pre-loaded DASD. 2 program partitions
(P0 and P1) have been genned. There is no working TOD clock, and no SMF.
Volume DLIB01 which is specified does not exist in the zipped file, but can
be created using a plf file with the CDROM of OS/360. DLIB01 can be
commented-out from the config (cnf) file if desired. The mftr33 package also
includes the IPL text and program for the standalone IBCDASD program as file
"ibcdasdi.rdr" which can be used if desired.</P>
<H4>Where can I find documentation?</H4>
<P>I've produced a document describing how to build an OS/360 system on
Hercules, called "OS/360 on Hercules". It can be found at <A
HREF="http://www.conmicro.cx/hercos360">http://www.conmicro.cx/hercos360</A>.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</A> document describes
various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD volumes. </P>
<P>Malcolm Beattie has also produced two useful documents on 3270s and TSO:
<BR> "Guide to Using 3270 Consoles and Terminals for Hercules" at <A
HREF="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mbeattie/hercules/3270.html">http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mbeattie/hercules/3270.html</A>

HREF="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mbeattie/hercules/tso.html">http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mbeattie/hercules/tso.html</A>
</P>
<P>For adding multiple 3270 terminals to TCAM, see the document by Mike Ross
at <A
HREF="http://www.corestore.org/hercules.html">http://www.corestore.org/hercules.html</A>
</P>
<H4>What are the licensing restrictions for Hercules?</H4>

<P>Hercules is a copyright work which has been made generally
available, subject to the terms of the
<A HREF="herclic.html">Q Public License</A>.
In essence this allows free use and distribution of the program for
personal and commercial use.  You may not distribute modified copies
of the program, but you may distribute your own patches along with
the program, provided that you also grant the maintainer permission
to include those patches in future versions of the program.  You may
not copy any portion of the source code for use in any other program.</p>
<P>Hercules is <EM>not</EM>, repeat, <EM>not</EM> GPL software! The GNU
General Public License is a Unix/Linux software licensing agreement, which
we, the authors, will not participate in. We believe that the QPL, which has
been certified as compliant with the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Definition</a>, provides the
benefits and protections of open source for both users and developers,
without the political baggage that has come to be associated with the GPL.</P>
<H4>What PC hardware do I need to run Hercules?</H4>
<P>It depends how fast you want it to run. A Pentium 200 with 32Mb RAM is
probably the minimum practical requirement; 500+ MHz with 128Mb RAM would be
much better. Hercules doesn't use any fancy graphics, but it does need a
fast processor to achieve a reasonable MIPS rate.
</P>
<P>If you can afford a multiprocessor system, so much the better. Hercules
makes extensive use of multithreading to overlap I/O with CPU activity, so
you should find that a dual or quad Pentium 200 system will outperform a
uniprocessor Pentium 450. My development system is a Compaq ProLiant 6000
with four Pentium Pro 200s, and response time is quite satisfactory. </P>
<P>Hercules does not depend on the Pentium architecture. I've built and run
it successfully on a 500 MHz Alpha 21164, and others have run it on SPARC
and S/390 (!) Linux systems. (One guy has even run OS/360 under Hercules
under Linux/390 under Hercules under Linux/390 under VM/ESA!) The only
weirdness about building the package on an Alpha is that you'll get compiler
warnings about "unsigned long value, unsigned long long format". You can
ignore these. </P>
<P>You will need enough Linux swap space to accommodate your S/390 real
storage (main storage plus expanded storage). For maximum throughput, you
should set your main and expanded storage sizes high enough to eliminate
S/390 paging. S/390 storage is allocated out of Linux virtual storage, so if
you can provide enough RAM to eliminate Linux paging as well, then so much
the better. </P>
<P>You also need enough hard disk space to accommodate the emulated DASD. A
virtual "3330 model 1" disk drive will need about 100 megabytes of space for
emulation (a 3330-11 will need about 200 megabytes). A 3380 "single density"
model will need about 650MB, and a 3390 model 2 needs about 2GB. If you use
the <a href="cckddasd.html">compressed CKD DASD feature</a>, these sizes will
shrink dramatically, usually to about 20 to 30 percent of the original
size.</P>
<H4><A NAME="software">What PC software do I need to run Hercules? </A></H4>
<P>1. You need a Linux system with POSIX threads (pthread) support. I will
only provide support for Linux 2.2.x or later kernels with glibc2 (libc6) as
supplied in popular distributions such as Red Hat 6.0 or later and SuSE
Linux 6.1 or later. My development system runs Red Hat 6.1. You can also run
under Windows NT or Windows 2000, though Hercules isn't quite as polished on
that platform.</P>
<P>2. A recent version of the GNU C compiler (GCC), normally
distributed with Linux. See the notes below on this compiler. If you
wish to rebuild the Windows version, you will need the <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">Cygwin</a> tools from Red
Hat.</P>
<P>3. You will also need tn3270 client software for the virtual 3270
console.  The tn3270 client can run on the same machine as Hercules, or
on any Unix or Windows box with a TCP/IP connection to the Hercules
machine.</P>
<P>The supported and recommended tn3270 clients for Hercules are:
<dl>
<dt><B>x3270 for Unix</B>
<dd>x3270 is included with most Linux distributions, or you can
download it from
<a HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley?Peaks/7814">
www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/7814</A>
<dt><B>Vista tn3270 for Windows</B>
<dd>Vista tn3270 can be obtained from
<a HREF="http://www.tombrennansoftware.com">
www.tombrennansoftware.com</a>.  The very modest license fee charged
for this excellent 3270 emulator helps to support an independent
software developer.
</dl>
<P>Other tn3270 clients, such as QWS3270, IBM Personal Communications,
Attachmate Extra, or Dynacomm Elite should also work in most cases, but
be aware that some tn3270 clients have bugs which make them unusable
as OS/360 or MVS consoles.</P>
<H4>What sort of MIPS rate can I expect?</H4>
<P>Thanks to the performance enhancements which began around release 1.60,
as a result of work by Mike Noel, Juergen Dobrinski, Valery Pogonchenko, and
Jan Jaeger, you should now see an execution speed of around 0.8 to 1 MIPS,
even on a Pentium 200.  That's enough to run OS/360 (MFT or MVT) with a
response time similar to that of a 3033 from the 1970's. It's also fast
enough to run VSE/ESA with an acceptable response time. If you want to run
OS/390 instead of OS/360 (assuming you can do so legally), you'd better get
a gigahertz or so Pentium III.  On a fast dual Pentium III it's now not
unusual to see 10 MIPS or better.</P>
<P>Typical I/O rates of around 50 EXCP/second are reported on average
hardware, with rates over 500/second achievable with hardware RAID. </P>
<H4>Which C compiler should I use to build Hercules?</H4>
<P>You <EM>must</EM> use GCC 2.9x, previously known as EGCS. I am
using the version that came with Red Hat 6.1 and it seems to work
OK. The version number reported by the Linux command <code>cc
-v</code> is: egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release). If
your compiler is version 2.9 or higher, it's EGCS-based, and should
work fine, as EGCS version 1 is just another name for gcc version
2.9.</P>
<P>Older versions of gcc are known to produce incorrect code for some 64-bit
(unsigned long) integer operations. I have had reports that earlier versions
of egcs produce strange results too. </P>
<P>If you have both an old gcc and egcs compilers installed, use the CC
parameter on the "make" command to force it to choose the correct compiler:
<BR> <CODE>make CC=egcs</CODE> ...</P>
<p>Red Hat 7.0 ships with two versions of gcc. If you don't do anything
special, you get gcc 2.96, which will not compile the Linux kernel, so they
included 2.91 as well as <code>kgcc</code>. If you encounter problems when
building Hercules with the 2.96 compiler, try <code>make CC=kgcc</code>
instead. I would appreciate reports as to how well the 2.96 compiler works,
as it is a development snapshot, and lots of folks, including the GCC
development team and Linus Torvalds, were very unhappy that Red Hat included
it in their distribution.</p>
<H4>Why do I get an unexpected fixed-point divide exception (program check
0009 or abend 0C9) on a CVB instruction?</H4>
<P>You are using an old gcc compiler. You must use the newer egcs-based
compiler instead. See previous question for the required compiler level.
</P>
<H4>Do you plan to port Hercules to other platforms?</H4>
<P>No. I do not have the resources to support more than one operating
system. </P>
<P>If you want to make Hercules run on Solaris, Linux 2.0.x, or whatever,
then by all means go ahead. I welcome reports of any bugs or problems you
find, but I probably won't fix problems if it means introducing
platform-specific code, and I will not be able to test new releases against
other platforms. Folks who have gotten it compiled on the BSDs report that
the hardest part is removing the Linux-specific tape support. Hercules is
part of the FreeBSD packages collection.</P>
<p>There is ongoing work to make Hercules run under Windows 98, NT, and
2000. The source code has support for these platforms included, and there is
a Win32 makefile as makefile.w32.</p>
<P>The Hercules code is not intended to be specific to Intel hardware, so if
you find any issues or faults related to running on other hardware (SPARC,
Alpha, PPC, ...) under Linux 2.2, then I'm likely to be receptive to fixing
that sort of problem. Issues related to Unix variants are less likely
to be fixed. </P>
<H4>How can I create a virtual DASD volume?</H4>
<P>The <A HREF="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</A> document describes
various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD volumes. </P>
<H4>Can I read a tape which was created on a mainframe?</H4>
<P>Yes, indirectly. The mainframe tape must be converted to AWSTAPE format
and then downloaded to your PC. The <B><I>tapeconv.jcl</B></I> file in the
Hercules directory contains a sample program which you can run under OS/390
on your mainframe system. It reads a file from tape and converts it to
AWSTAPE format. Download the AWSTAPE file to your PC (making sure to choose
<EM>binary</EM> format for the download), and then add the downloaded
filename to the Hercules configuration file as a virtual tape device. You
will then be able to read the tape file from the virtual tape drive located
on your PC.</P>
<EM><P>Note: the "tapeconv" program will not correctly process input tapes
whose block size exceeds 32760!</EM> One symptom of this may be the message
"<CODE>ADRY011E I/O ERROR - DEVICE NOT ATTACHED.0000,NA,00...00,0000"</CODE>
when attempting to restore from tape originally created using the default
DF/DSS block size. The solution is to recreate the dump tape with
DCB=BLKSIZE=32760. </P>
<H4>Can I attach a PC tape drive to Hercules?</H4>
<P>Yes. Hercules can read and write tapes on SCSI drives on Linux systems. I
have tested this with 4mm DAT, QIC-1000, and 9-track drives. The Cygwin
libraries that support Hercules on Windows do not provide support for SCSI
tapes.</P>
<H4>Can I process mainframe tapes with Hercules?</H4>
<P>Yes.  It is possible to obtain 9-track open reel drives and 3480-type
cartridge drives which attach to the SCSI bus.  Hercules makes these
appear to the operating system as channel-attached 3420 or 3480 devices,
making it possible to read and write real mainframe tapes. </P>
<H4>Can I create Assembler programs without a mainframe?</H4>
<P>Yes. If you want to write Assembler (BAL) programs to run on Hercules,
but you don't have access to a mainframe, then there are two interesting
products which you can run on your PC to assemble programs: </P>
<DL>
<DT>The "Tachyon 390 Cross Assembler" (<A
HREF="http://www.tachyonsoft.com/tachyon">
http://www.tachyonsoft.com/tachyon</A>) </DT>
<DD>With this assembler you can produce S/390-compatible object decks using
your Linux or Windows PC. A high degree of HLASM compatibility, coupled with
the ability to perform complex assemblies at lightning speed, make this a
product which is well worth looking at. I have tried this assembler and it
is truly amazing. </DD>
<DT>The "Dignus Systems/C Compiler" (<A HREF="http://www.dignus.com/">
http://www.dignus.com</A>) </DT>
<DD>This is a C compiler which runs under Windows or Linux and generates
mainframe assembler code which you can then assemble using the Tachyon
assembler. </DD>
</DL>
<P>Sam Golob wrote a fascinating review of these two products in the
September 1999 issue of NaSPA Technical Support magazine. </P>

z/OS version 1.1 in ARCHLVL 1 mode, and Linux and z/VM in both ESA/390 and
z/Architecture mode.</p>
<H4>What z/Architecture features are implemented?</H4>
<P>z/Architecture includes as standard all of the features of ESA/390,
except vector operations, which is not part of the z/Architecture.
It also includes new standard features such as 5-level DAT, 64-bit
