    What is Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Hercules is a software implementation of the System/370, ESA/390 and
    z/Architecture hardware which runs under Linux on several hardware
    platforms including the Intel Pentium PC, and under Windows NT and
    Windows 2000.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="1.02">1.02</A>
    So what exactly does that mean?
</H4>
<P>
    It means that your PC can emulate an IBM mainframe processor. The
    mainframe can range from a 360 to a z900 - running in "System/370" mode,
    "ESA/390" mode, or "z/Architecture" mode.
</P>
<P>
    Hercules executes S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture instructions
    and channel programs.  It emulates mainframe I/O devices by using
    PC devices.  For example, 3390 DASD devices are emulated by large
    files on your hard disk, and local 3270 screens are emulated by tn3270
    sessions. (Note: Not all 370 and 390 features have been implemented
    in Hercules. See the list of particulars later in this document.
    Also, certain non-standard models, 360/20s, and the 360/67 virtual
    memory mode are not emulated.)
</P>
<P>
    Hercules implements only the raw S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture
    instruction set; it does not provide any operating system facilities.
    This means that you need to provide an operating system or standalone
    program which Hercules can load from an emulated disk or tape device.
    You will have to write the operating system or standalone program
    yourself, unless you can manage to obtain a license from IBM to run
    one of their operating systems on your PC, or use IBM programs and
    operating systems which have been placed in the public domain.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="1.03">1.03</A>
    Is it functional enough to run production work?
</H4>
<P>
    No. At the moment it's a system programmer's toy, though it's rapidly
    becoming good enough to run a wide range of software without problems. 
</P>
<H4><A NAME="1.04">1.04</A>
    What are the licensing restrictions for Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Hercules is a copyright work which has been made generally
    available, subject to the terms of the
<A HREF="herclic.html">Q Public License</A>.
    In essence this allows free use and distribution of the program for
    personal and commercial use.  You may not distribute modified copies
    of the program, but you may distribute your own patches along with
    the program, provided that you also grant the maintainer permission
    to include those patches in future versions of the program.  You may
    not copy any portion of the source code for use in any other program.
</p>
<P>
    Hercules is <EM>not</EM>, repeat, <EM>not</EM> GPL software! The GNU
    General Public License is a Unix/Linux software licensing agreement,
    which we, the authors, will not participate in. We believe that the
    QPL, which has been certified as compliant with the 
<a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Definition</a>,
    provides the benefits and protections of open source for both users and
    developers, without the political baggage that has come to be associated
    with the GPL.
</P>
<P>
<HR>
</P>
<H4><A NAME="2.01">2.01</A>
    Can it run OS/390, VM/ESA, VSE/ESA?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes. Hercules is a software implementation of ESA/390, and so it is
    capable of running OS/390, VSE/ESA, and VM/ESA, as well as older
    versions of these OS's.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="2.02">2.02</A>
    What operating systems can I run legally?
</H4>
<P>
    Most 3rd party operating systems like Linux/390, z/Linux and TELPAR
    are covered under their own <em>free</em> license and can therefore
    run under Hercules without any legal problems.
</P>
<P>
    <em>OS/360</em> (PCP, MFT and MVT) is in the public domain, as far
    as we know. The status of OSes for which IBM did not charge a license
    fee is somewhat murky; these include <em>MVS</em> 3.8, <em>VM/370</em>
    release 6, and <em>DOS/VS</em> release 34.
</P>
<P>
    The legal status outside the USA, where something like public domain or
    software without copyright doesn't exist, is "copyrighted software
    provided at no charge". It is a known fact that vendors like
    <em>amdahl</em>, <em>Hitachi</em>, <em>Nixdorf</em> and others
    modified those operating systems, and distributed them as their own
    OS for their own hardware, without asking IBM for permission. But
    law had been changed over that time, so its not clear if the same
    legal status applies in <b>your</b> country right now.
</P>
<P>
    Rick Fochtman managed to optain a letter from IBM that he is allowed
    to distribute OS/360. Try to ask your salesdroid for a similar letter
    for VM/370, MVS 3.8j or DOS/VS next time he wants to sell you a major
    upgrade.
</P>
<P>
    OS/390 and other ESA versions of OS's are definitely licensed to a
    particular machine. Therefore, in practice you cannot run any classic
    ESA operating system on your PC unless you can obtain a license from
    IBM allowing you to do so. It is believed that there are, however,
    three legal ways you could run OS/390, VM/ESA, or VSE/ESA under
    Hercules:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
    Running under Linux on the Pentium processor of a P/390 which is
    licensed to run the OS. 
</LI>
<LI>
    Running under Linux/390 on a mainframe which is licensed to run the OS.
</LI>
<LI>
    Running under the terms of a disaster recovery provision of the OS
    license (but I really don't recommend depending on Hercules to be your
    disaster recovery solution!). 
</LI>
</OL>
<H4><A NAME="2.03">2.03</A>
    What other programs will run under Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Any program which uses the S/370, ESA/390, or z/Architecture instruction
    set, as implemented in Hercules. Some special utilities in the form of
    standalone programs are known to run well. I can particularly recommend
    Jan Jaeger's excellent standalone editor (ZZSA) which is included in the
    Hercules distribution, or it can be downloaded from 
<A HREF="http://home.worldonline.nl/~jjaeger">http://home.worldonline.nl/~jjaeger</A>;
    I use it regularly to look at DASD while debugging an OS installation,
    which is just what it's designed to do. Note: ZZSA runs in ESA/390 mode.
    See Jan Jaeger's website for more information and special logon procedures.

<H4><A NAME="3.01">3.01</A>
    What PC hardware do I need to run Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    It depends how fast you want it to run. A Pentium 200 with 32Mb RAM is
    probably the minimum practical requirement; 500+ MHz with 128Mb RAM would
    be much better. Hercules doesn't use any fancy graphics, but it does
    need a fast processor to achieve a reasonable MIPS rate.
</P>
<P>
    If you can afford a multiprocessor system, so much the better. Hercules
    makes extensive use of multithreading to overlap I/O with CPU activity, so
    you should find that a dual or quad Pentium 200 system will outperform a
    uniprocessor Pentium 450. My development system is a Compaq ProLiant 6000
    with four Pentium Pro 200s, and response time is quite satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
    Hercules does not depend on the Pentium architecture. I've built and run
    it successfully on a 500 MHz Alpha 21164, and others have run it on SPARC
    and S/390 (!) Linux systems. (One guy has even run OS/360 under Hercules
    under Linux/390 under Hercules under Linux/390 under VM/ESA!) The only
    weirdness about building the package on an Alpha is that you'll get
    compiler warnings about "unsigned long value, unsigned long long format".
    You can ignore these. 
</P>
<P>
    You will need enough Linux swap space to accommodate your S/390 real
    storage (main storage plus expanded storage). For maximum throughput, you
    should set your main and expanded storage sizes high enough to eliminate
    S/390 paging. S/390 storage is allocated out of Linux virtual storage,
    so if you can provide enough RAM to eliminate Linux paging as well,
    then so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
    You also need enough hard disk space to accommodate the emulated DASD. A
    virtual "3330 model 1" disk drive will need about 100 megabytes of space
    for emulation (a 3330-11 will need about 200 megabytes). A 3380 "single
    density" model will need about 650MB, and a 3390 model 2 needs about 2GB.
    If you use the 
<a href="cckddasd.html">compressed CKD DASD feature</a>,
    these sizes will shrink dramatically, usually to about 20 to 30 percent
    of the original size.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="3.02">3.02</A>
    What PC software do I need to run Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    1. You need a Linux system with POSIX threads (pthread) support. I will
    only provide support for Linux 2.2.x kernels with glibc2 (libc6) as
    supplied in popular distributions such as Red Hat 6.0 or later and
    SuSE Linux 6.1 or later. My development system runs Red Hat 6.1.
    You can also run under Windows NT or Windows 2000, though Hercules
    isn't quite as polished on that platform.
</P>
<P>
    2. An egcs C compiler, normally distributed with Linux. See the notes
    below on this compiler. If you wish to rebuild the Windows version,
    you will need the 
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">Cygwin</a>
    tools from Red Hat.
</P>
<P>
    3. You will also need tn3270 client software for the virtual 3270
    console.  The tn3270 client can run on the same machine as Hercules, or
    on any Unix or Windows box with a TCP/IP connection to the Hercules
    machine.
</P>
<P>
    The supported and recommended tn3270 clients for Hercules are:
<dl>
<dt>
<B>
    x3270 for Unix
</B>
<dd>
    x3270 is included with most Linux distributions, or you can
    download it from
<a HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley?Peaks/7814">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/7814</A>
<dt>
<B>
    Vista tn3270 for Windows
</B>
<dd>
    Vista tn3270 can be obtained from
<a HREF="http://www.tombrennansoftware.com">www.tombrennansoftware.com</a>.
    The very modest license fee charged for this excellent 3270 emulator
    helps to support an independent software developer.
</dl>
<P>
    Other tn3270 clients, such as QWS3270, IBM Personal Communications,
    Attachmate Extra, or Dynacomm Elite should also work in most cases, but
    be aware that some tn3270 clients have bugs which make them unusable
    as OS/360 or MVS consoles.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="3.03">3.03</A>
    What sort of MIPS rate can I expect?
</H4>
<P>
    With the performance enhancements which began around release 1.60,
    thanks to work by Juergen Dobrinski, Valery Pogonchenko, and Jan Jaeger,
    you should now see an execution speed of around 0.8 to 1 MIPS, even on a
    Pentium 200.  That's enough to run OS/360 (MFT or MVT) with a response
    time similar to that of a 3033 from the 1970's. It's also fast enough to
    run VSE/ESA with an acceptable response time. If you want to run OS/390
    instead of OS/360, you'd better get a gigahertz or so Pentium III.  On a
    fast dual Pentium III it's now not unusual to see 5 MIPS or better.
</P>
<P>
    Typical I/O rates of around 50 EXCP/second are reported on average
    hardware, with rates over 500/second achievable with hardware RAID. 
</P>
<H4><A NAME="3.04">3.04</A>
    Which C compiler should I use to build Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    You <EM>must</EM> use the egcs C compiler. I am using the version that
    came with Red Hat 6.1 and it seems to work OK. The version number reported
    by the Linux command <code>cc -v</code> is: egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux
    (egcs-1.1.2 release). If your compiler is version 2.9 or higher, it's
    EGCS-based, and should work fine, as EGCS version 1 is just another name
    for gcc version 2.9.
</P>
<P>
    The older gcc compiler is known to produce incorrect code for some 64-bit
    (unsigned long) integer operations. I have had reports that earlier
    versions of egcs produce strange results too. 
</P>
<P>
    If you have both an old gcc and egcs compilers installed, use the CC
    parameter on the "make" command to force it to choose the correct compiler:
<BR>
<CODE>make CC=egcs</CODE> ...
</P>
<p>
    Red Hat 7.0 ships with two versions of gcc. If you don't do anything
    special, you get gcc 2.96, which will not compile the Linux kernel, so
    they included 2.91 as well as <code>kgcc</code>. If you encounter
    problems when building Hercules with the 2.96 compiler, try
<code>make CC=kgcc</code>
    instead. I would appreciate reports as to how well the 2.96 compiler works,
    as it is a development snapshot, and lots of folks, including the GCC
    development team ad Linus Torvalds, were very unhappy that Red Hat included
    it in their distribution.

    Why do I get an unexpected fixed-point divide exception (program check 
    0009 or abend 0C9) on a CVB instruction?
</H4>
<P>
    You are using an old gcc compiler. You must use the newer egcs-based
    compiler instead. See previous question for the required compiler level.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="3.06">3.06</A>
    Do you plan to port Hercules to other platforms?
</H4>
<P>
    Not really, no. We simply do not have the resources to support more than
    one operating system.
</P>
<P>
    It should be noted however that we do make efforts to ensure Hercules
    builds and run on several different operating system platforms (mostly
    just Linux, Windows and Apple right now), but we of course simply cannot
    guarantee that it will run on every operating system platform out there.
</P>
<P>
    If you want to make Hercules run on FreeBSD, Solaris, Linux 2.0.x, or
    whatever, then by all means go ahead. I welcome reports of any bugs or
    problems you find, but I probably won't fix problems if it means introducing
    platform-specific code, and I will not be able to test new releases against
    other platforms. Folks who have gotten it compiled on the BSDs report that
    the hardest part is removing the Linux-specific tape support. 
</P>
<P>
    The Hercules code is not intended to be specific to Intel hardware, so if
    you find any issues or faults related to running on other hardware (SPARC,
    Alpha, PPC, ...) under Linux 2.2, then I'm likely to be receptive to fixing
    that sort of problem. Issues related to Unix variants are less likely
    to be fixed however.

    How can I create a virtual DASD volume?
</H4>
<P>
    The 
<A HREF="hercload.html">
    Creating Hercules DASD
</A>
    document describes
    various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD volumes. 
</P>
<H4><A NAME="4.02">4.02</A>
    Can I read a tape which was created on a mainframe?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes, indirectly. The mainframe tape must be converted to AWSTAPE format
    and then downloaded to your PC. The 
<B><I>tapeconv.jcl</I></B>
    file in the
    Hercules directory contains a sample program which you can run under OS/390
    on your mainframe system. It reads a file from tape and converts it to
    AWSTAPE format. Download the AWSTAPE file to your PC (making sure to choose
<EM>binary</EM>
    format for the download), and then add the downloaded
    filename to the Hercules configuration file as a virtual tape device. You
    will then be able to read the tape file from the virtual tape drive located
    on your PC.
</P>
<P>
<EM>
    Note: the "tapeconv" program will not correctly process input tapes
    whose block size exceeds 32760!
</EM>
    One symptom of this may be the message "
<CODE>ADRY011E I/O ERROR - DEVICE NOT ATTACHED.0000,NA,00...00,0000"</CODE>
    when attempting to restore from tape originally created using the default
    DF/DSS block size. The solution is to recreate the dump tape with
    DCB=BLKSIZE=32760. 
</P>
<H4><A NAME="4.03">4.03</A>
    Can I attach a PC tape drive to Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes. Hercules can read and write tapes on SCSI drives. I have tested this
    with 4mm DAT, QIC-1000, and 9-track drives. 
</P>
<H4><A NAME="4.04">4.04</A>
    Can I process mainframe tapes with Hercules?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes.  It is possible to obtain 9-track open reel drives and 3480-type
    cartridge drives which attach to the SCSI bus.  Hercules makes these
    appear to the operating system as channel-attached 3420 or 3480 devices,
    making it possible to read and write real mainframe tapes. 
</P>
<H4><A NAME="4.05">4.05</A>
    Can I create Assembler programs without a mainframe?
</H4>
<P>
    Yes. If you want to write Assembler (BAL) programs to run on Hercules,
    but you don't have access to a mainframe, then there are two interesting
    products which you can run on your PC to assemble programs: 
</P>
<DL>
<DT>
    The "Tachyon 390 Cross Assembler" (
<A HREF="http://www.tachyonsoft.com/tachyon">http://www.tachyonsoft.com/tachyon</A>
    ) 
</DT>
<DD>
    With this assembler you can produce S/390-compatible object decks using
    your Linux or Windows PC. A high degree of HLASM compatibility, coupled with
    the ability to perform complex assemblies at lightning speed, make this a
    product which is well worth looking at. I have tried this assembler and it
    is truly amazing. 
</DD>
<DT>
    The "Dignus Systems/C Compiler" (
<A HREF="http://www.dignus.com/">http://www.dignus.com</A>
    ) 
</DT>
<DD>
    This is a C compiler which runs under Windows or Linux and generates
    mainframe assembler code which you can then assemble using the Tachyon
    assembler. 
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
    Sam Golob wrote a fascinating review of these two products in the
    September 1999 issue of NaSPA Technical Support magazine.
