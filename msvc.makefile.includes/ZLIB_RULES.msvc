# NOTE: to be safe, since this member contains build rules, we need to
# make sure there's always a blank line following the last build rule
# in the member so that nmake doesn't complain or otherwise treat the
# statements immediately following the original !INCLUDE statement as
# part of the build rule actions. Thus the purpose of the comments you
# are now reading as the very last few lines in every build rule member.
