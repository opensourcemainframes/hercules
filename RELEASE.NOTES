                     Version 2.18 RELEASE NOTES


- Reminder that CTCI device handling was changed starting with version 2.17
  as follows:

  - The CTCI-W32 protocol is deprecated. You should use the CTCI protocol
    instead.

  - You MUST NOT define both even/odd CTCI device pairs in your configuration
    file. You should ONLY define the first even numbered device. Hercules will
    automatically define the odd numbered device for you. If you define the
    odd numbered device by mistake, an open error will occur on that device.
    This is by design. See the README.NETWORKING document for further details.


- Hercules Dynamic Loader support: starting with version 2.18, Hercules now
  contains support for the dynamic loading of certain modules upon startup on
  some platforms (e.g. Linux and Windows for example). As a result of this new
  feature, "Hercules" itself now no longer consists of just the 'hercules.exe'
  module by itself, but rather consists of BOTH the 'hercules.exe' program AS
  WELL AS whatever dynamic modules (DLLs) that accompany it.

  As a result if this change, whenever you install a new version of Hercules,
  you must ensure that you ALSO install the accompanying new versions of the
  new dynamic modules as well. Attempting to use a version of Hercules with a
  dynamic module that was not specifically built for that version will cause
  loading of that dynamic module to fail.

  You CANNOT mix versions of hercules with differing versions of dynamically
  loaded modules.

  Ensure that your library path LD_LIBRARY_PATH set correctly such that it
  includes the directory of your hercules executables

- ECPS:VM: Do not use ECPS:VM (See README.ECPSVM) in an AP or MP environment
  in VM/370. If AP=YES or MP=YES is coded in DMKSYS and the AP/MP control
  file is used to build the CP nucleus and NUMCPU is set to more than 1 in
  the hercules.cnf file, any of LOK001, LOK003 or other abends will occur.
  This occurs because the hercules ECPS:VM CP Assist implementation is not
  MP safe, and particularily, attemps VM dispatching without holding necessary
  AP or MP locks.

- Anything else???
